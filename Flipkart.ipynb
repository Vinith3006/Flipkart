The camera is top notch best camera in this segment and display too is marvelous, The processor too is good but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the heating problem.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 23 FE has amazing display and smoothness for day to day task which is not heavy. Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

The camera is top notch best camera in this segment and display too is marvelous, The processor too is good but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the heating problem.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 23 FE has amazing display and smoothness for day to day task which is not heavy. Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is good overall. The camera is top notch best camera in this segment and display too is marvelous, The processor too is good but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the heating problem. Yes the phone gets hot even if u do simple tasks, the battery too is good but I think Samsung could do better. I would still advice u to buy the phone but keep the heating issue in mind\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 23 FE has amazing display and smoothness for day to day task which is not heavy. Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",

It clicks good photos.. both day and night. The phone is really fast and smooth  Finger print scanner is also great except one or two times. Metallic side designs is also great\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall better than any other phone except for s23ultra😉\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.  Thank you, flipkart, for providing such fantastic deals.\n",

Camera's potrait and zoom pictures are excellent  But concern is that hope Samsung doesn't slow it down on future updates so as to promote newer galaxies\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone on Flipkart GOAT sale. Got it in 47k 256 gb variant. Using it for almost a month. 1. Camera , display, performance is quite impressive. 2. I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

Battery: 4/5 u can get 7.30 hours SOT with wifi and 6 hours on 5g data with one charge 4. Camera : 5/5 can beat iphone 15 too.. and it easily beats iphone 14 camera 5.

Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",

Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

Pros- Despite being a compact phone it comes with decent batter life of 6+ hours , camera is top notch and performance is really good in this compact powerhouse , thanks to snapdragon 8gen2. Cons - There is fingerprint scanning issue sometimes due to tempered glass and sometimes it may become warm depending on the conditions, but it can be considered, considering it's a compact device so somewhat heating issue may occur . Final verdict - This would be a perfect phone for you if you like using compact phones in front of these huge display phones and the features offered in this device with this perfect size doesn't feel real, that how they all can be compiled in such a perfect size device .\n",

The camera is top notch best camera in this segment and display too is marvelous, The processor too is good but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the heating problem.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 23 FE has amazing display and smoothness for day to day task which is not heavy. Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE 128GB variant delivers an almost flagship-level experience with its stunning display, powerful performance, and versatile camera system. The only significant drawback is the battery life, which might not suffice for power users. Nevertheless, for those seeking a high-quality smartphone at a reasonable price, the Galaxy S23 FE is a compelling choice that offers great value for money.Overall, despite the battery backup issue, my experience with the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE has been amazing, making it a device I can confidently recommend to others.\n",

I'm fully satisfied with it, especially the night photography. 📸✨ However, there's a heating issue that I think is due to the Exynos processor. One suggestion: If you're planning to get an S23 FE, I'd recommend waiting a few months for the Snapdragon version. It'll be worth the wait!\n",

The camera is top notch best camera in this segment and display too is marvelous, The processor too is good but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the heating problem.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone, lovely weight balance. The in hand feel is amazing it's so lite that I barely feel it in my pocket. The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

Overall its a really good phone. Didnt like iphone much from the store. Moreover it felt like I am giving up too many features in iphone and the price range is similar.  Hence got the s23 and I absolutely love this phone.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: User experience is amazing. Display and performance are top notch! Camera is also really nice, best part, photos are natural. The only draw back is battery backup and heating issue, if these two things were better this would have been the best flagship in this range.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Delivery- Ontime Package - average first impression - Excellent Camera- very good user-friendly and lot many features Compact and solidly built. Good battery backup  Heating issue- this is only during charging. And it is expected behavior.\n",

It clicks good photos.. both day and night. The phone is really fast and smooth  Finger print scanner is also great except one or two times. Metallic side designs is also great\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I've used it for a month now and I can say one thing for sure, This is the best phone I've used till now. I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall better than any other phone except for s23ultra😉\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.  Thank you, flipkart, for providing such fantastic deals.\n",

I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

Battery: 4/5 u can get 7.30 hours SOT with wifi and 6 hours on 5g data with one charge 4. Camera : 5/5 can beat iphone 15 too.. and it easily beats iphone 14 camera 5. Overview: one if the best compact phone to buy for official use\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",

Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good phone but pricing is a bit higher. Battery backup is above average but samsung needs to improve changing technology. 15w charger takes almost 90 minutes but 25w also takes 75-80 min from 0-100. Camera is awesome. RAM Management is fabulous. Heating issue after some heavy tasks and even after using 10 min of camera app. Samsung needs to fix it with software update.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Camera is good,while charging the phone it's get heated\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's a nice phone considering if you like using compact phone . Pros- Despite being a compact phone it comes with decent batter life of 6+ hours , camera is top notch and performance is really good in this compact powerhouse , thanks to snapdragon 8gen2. Cons - There is fingerprint scanning issue sometimes due to tempered glass and sometimes it may become warm depending on the conditions, but it can be considered, considering it's a compact device so somewhat heating issue may occur . Final verdict - This would be a perfect phone for you if you like using compact phones in front of these huge display phones and the features offered in this device with this perfect size doesn't feel real, that how they all can be compiled in such a perfect size device .\n",

The only significant drawback is the battery life, which might not suffice for power users. Nevertheless, for those seeking a high-quality smartphone at a reasonable price, the Galaxy S23 FE is a compelling choice that offers great value for money.Overall, despite the battery backup issue, my experience with the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE has been amazing, making it a device I can confidently recommend to others.\n",

I'm fully satisfied with it, especially the night photography. 📸✨ However, there's a heating issue that I think is due to the Exynos processor. One suggestion: If you're planning to get an S23 FE, I'd recommend waiting a few months for the Snapdragon version. It'll be worth the wait!\n",

The camera is top notch best camera in this segment and display too is marvelous, The processor too is good but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the heating problem.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: though performance is good. But battery drains out very fast even on full charge . it can get to 60% within just 45 mins. My previous phone Samsung A12 is performing much better even after 3 years of continuous rough use.  Not to Forget, It gets heated up so much you can literally cook something it feels.  Very bad experience. Regretting my decision of buying it. Others might be obsessing over it's camera, AI etc. but still the basic things remains not as per expected.  Really Disappointed\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros: 1. Camera flagship level. 2. Display excellent. 3. Sound decent. 4. Software/UI excellent.  Cons: 1. Battery life is poor. Requires to be charged 2 times in a day. Had m51 previously which easily lasted for 2 days on medium usage even after 3 years. This one is a very step down from that. 2. Phone gets heated on medium usage (excluding gaming), but still manageable.\n",

Great camera quality and great video recording capabilities thanks to super stabilised video.  Battery is great too if you don't Play too much heavy games then it will last whole day.  Display is the best in the segment super bright and punchy, colours are just awesome ofcourse it is a Samsung display.  Man the processor.... What a great processor built by Qualcomm. Super powerful and battery efficient. You can throw any task it doesn't matter.  Everything is good you can go for it only the price a little higher side... If that is not your concern you can just blindly go for it.\n",

The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone, lovely weight balance. The in hand feel is amazing it's so lite that I barely feel it in my pocket. The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Delivery- Ontime Package - average first impression - Excellent Camera- very good user-friendly and lot many features Compact and solidly built. Good battery backup  Heating issue- this is only during charging. And it is expected behavior.\n",

It clicks good photos.. both day and night. The phone is really fast and smooth  Finger print scanner is also great except one or two times. Metallic side designs is also great\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall better than any other phone except for s23ultra😉\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.

I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: One of the best phones money can buy. But you will be left wanting for bigger battery and fast charging. 8/10\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Product is good Cons: While using cam heating issue Battery back up less When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor  Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium.  Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Best compact phone but there's no any update for VoNR yet. Only issue with Samsung flagships is that their fingerprint doesn't work well with any tempered glass.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Iam sharing my experience after 12 days of excessive use Display is top notch you can feel how premium it is. Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's a great phone to buy if u are looking for compact phone, but dont do the same mistake as I did . buy a thin slim case to enjoy the phones slim bezels . I bought a armored case and now besels looks thick\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The best compact phone in the market unless u get hands on asus zenfone 10.  The best part is its battery life which is excellent for a phone of this size and battery capacity With moderate to light use u can easily churn out between 6-7 hrs of SOT, heavy use 5-6 hrs  The display as always is fluid and bright  The phone feels great in hand due to its form factor  Cameras are good too  Main Camera 8.5/10 Wide angle 7.5/10 Telephoto 7.5/10 Portraits 8.5/10 Night 8.5/10 Selfie 8/10  How don't how samsung has managed to optimize this phone with such great efficiency and power.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good phone but pricing is a bit higher. Battery backup is above average but samsung needs to improve changing technology. 15w charger takes almost 90 minutes but 25w also takes 75-80 min from 0-100. Camera is awesome. RAM Management is fabulous. Heating issue after some heavy tasks and even after using 10 min of camera app. Samsung needs to fix it with software update.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Camera is good,while charging the phone it's get heated\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's a nice phone considering if you like using compact phone . Pros- Despite being a compact phone it comes with decent batter life of 6+ hours , camera is top notch and performance is really good in this compact powerhouse , thanks to snapdragon 8gen2. Cons - There is fingerprint scanning issue sometimes due to tempered glass and sometimes it may become warm depending on the conditions, but it can be considered, considering it's a compact device so somewhat heating issue may occur . Final verdict - This would be a perfect phone for you if you like using compact phones in front of these huge display phones and the features offered in this device with this perfect size doesn't feel real, that how they all can be compiled in such a perfect size device .\n",

The device aint a gaming device as it is a mid range processor but it really does serve the purpose of multi tasking, image processing etc you can do a bit of gaming but donot expect too much for that purpose. The display is next level and customisation experience is taken to a whole new level by thr Good Lock app and remember it needs to be updated as soon as taken out from the box. Loving the device and no heating issues are present, Im loving it. Camera is top notch too and you can get some pretty good images.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome phone the navy color looks so good, design is fantastic. Speakers r not like Samsung with default settings but when slider is set to 15-20% towards R the effect increases. The caller speaker (L) acts as a 2nd speaker so thats why sound quality weakens on default. Depends on person to person. A single charge 100% at around 9am will give all day backup (without heavy usage like games and all). But its a go for it phone for sure. No regrets. Delivery was very slow that's the only issue.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is an excellent mid-range smartphone that checks all the right boxes. Its impressive display, robust performance, and advanced camera capabilities make it a compelling choice for those seeking a reliable and feature-packed device.  *What I like:*  1. *Vibrant Display*: The 120Hz Super AMOLED display is stunning, offering vivid colors and crisp visuals. 2. *Long-Lasting Battery*: The 5000mAh battery easily lasts up to 2 days with moderate usage. 3. *Impressive Camera*: The 50MP primary sensor takes exceptional photos, even in low-light conditions. 4. *Sleek Design*: The phone's glass back and flat side frame give it a premium feel. 5. *Seamless Performance*: The device handles daily tasks and gaming with ease, thanks to its powerful processor.  *What I hate:*  1. *No Telephoto Lens*: The lack of a telephoto lens limits the camera's zoom capabilities. 2. *No Headphone Jack*: The absence of a headphone jack might inconvenience some users. 3. *Software Updates*: While the phone receives regular updates, the process can be slow. 4. *Fingerprint Sensor*: The in-display fingerprint sensor can be finicky at times.  *Verdict:*  The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is an outstanding mid-range smartphone that offers exceptional value. While it has some minor drawbacks, its numerous strengths make it an excellent choice for anyone seeking a reliable and feature-rich device.  *Recommendation:*  If you're looking for a well-rounded smartphone with advanced camera capabilities, a stunning display, and robust performance, the Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is definitely worth considering.  *Pros:*  - Excellent display - Long-lasting battery - Impressive camera - Sleek design - Seamless performance  *Cons:*  - No telephoto lens - No headphone jack - Software updates can be slow - Fingerprint sensor issues\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone looks like a flagship one. Display is crisp. All features provided are good. Unnecessary apps are there. You can either uninstall or disable them. Camera is not so good but not bad. I am a normal user. 10 to 15 phone calls, 1 hour browsing, half an hour chatting, 15 to 20 minutes video call,daily. The battery lasts for two days with 15 to 20 percent balance (Keep the net connection On always, but switched of Always On display, Keep the brightness at around 40%). The only problem I faced is the thickness of the phone. If you use a phone cover, the phone becomes bulkier. You cannot hold it for a longer period using one hand. Overall a good phone. One will not be disappointed purchasing this phone.\n",

Forget about even Installing Games to it. 4) It takes more than 2 hours to get fully charge and hardly charge remain for a day even with the basic usage. 5) Sound quality is so worst that you can hardly listen to some calls or even watch video without headphones\n",

The device aint a gaming device as it is a mid range processor but it really does serve the purpose of multi tasking, image processing etc you can do a bit of gaming but donot expect too much for that purpose. The display is next level and customisation experience is taken to a whole new level by thr Good Lock app and remember it needs to be updated as soon as taken out from the box. Loving the device and no heating issues are present, Im loving it. Camera is top notch too and you can get some pretty good images.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome phone the navy color looks so good, design is fantastic. Speakers r not like Samsung with default settings but when slider is set to 15-20% towards R the effect increases. The caller speaker (L) acts as a 2nd speaker so thats why sound quality weakens on default. Depends on person to person. A single charge 100% at around 9am will give all day backup (without heavy usage like games and all). But its a go for it phone for sure. No regrets. Delivery was very slow that's the only issue.\n",

Pros: excelllent build quality. display is bright enough in full sunlight. battery drops down to 30% end of the day which is more than enough for a average or higher average user. (AI optimizes battery as per user's usage) no network issue found yet .. call quality is very good till now as compared to pixel 4a. phones heats up during first set up but after andriod 14 update no such heavy heating observed.  cons: thick bezel. charging is a bit slow.  so all those youtuber's who gave negetive feedback either did not get paid by google or the issues has been fixed by google with OTA updates.\n",

Battery backup is good with 50% consumption in half day at moderate usage and charges mobile with apple adapter at 20% in 30mins, wireless charging at 2% in 5 minutes. Have used Costar 33w fast charger to charge Pixel7a by 40% in 35 mins. Live Captions on voice call is great feature !!! Fingerprint unlocking using screen protector has issues and it works well only if we enroll four times same finger with the screen protector and the protector mode On in settings. Installing Android 14 version has improved battery performance and improved fingerprint unlocking.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Update: Heats a Lot , if you are living in a state with more than 32 degree. dont go for it because it heats a lot  Pros.  Camera Os Display Chip(not for extreme gaming) - optimized with os makes a better user experience. The chip delivers near flagship grade performance. But not the best chip for long gaming sessions  Cons  Charging time is a high  Heating is Normal but some times it heats a little. Maybe it's because of the two x1 chip design and the x1 is an ML powerhouse which is a big part of a Google design\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: When you go with Google as a brand, of course you want performance with premium touch, which pixel 7A does provide without a doubt.  1. Camera is 10/10 2. The battery is good as of now, and will improve as it studies usage patterns and makes adjustments in background apps. 3. Design is awesome, the colour is awesome. The body is light weight but strong and durable. 4. 90Hz refresh rate, it doesn't feel like it is lacking 120Hz at all. Its smooth as Cream. 5. There is a little heat issue specially on left edge. 6. Tensor G2 processor, didn't really tried gaming, but multitasking is easy and chill. 7. For charging there is an adaptive mode which slows charging, switched it off and was charging fine, 30 minutes to 50-60% battery.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Using it for two days now, I can see why people are complaining about the heating but I haven't bought it for gaming so not a problem for me, camera design build quality and os are perfect, the only complaint I have is that they should include screen protector in box as this is recent release and its not available anywhere in market also the 2 other accessories in box are completely useless. If anyone is looking for this details but 7 back cover fits fine and custom cut screen protector for Samsung A52 also works for the time being. I was waiting for this for last 3 months so I am little biased but all there is not a single thing in this phone that makes it a deal breaker..\n",

First let's talk about problems. 1) Heating little more than other phones in this range.  2) Hanging, I am seeing extreme level of hanging in this phone. Recently I took a screenshot and the phone just hang there and nothing was working, after some try I used voice assistant to power off my device and now it works perfectly normal. I'm afraid this issue can be repeated.  3) network problem, and this one is very common in pixel 7 series phones.  Other than that everything works just fine and I'm happy about it. But Google has failed to solved some basic issues like hanging, network issues and battery life.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Superb, phone of google pixel A series\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Was one of the first ones to purchase Pixel 7a Snow White. Its a perfect pocket friendly, premium android smartphone that one can ask for. I got it for 39999 which might not be the final price (as price generally drops for pixel mid range phones in a couple of months). Let me list down pros and cons below:  PROS: 1. The device feels good in ur hand. Its compact, color coding is good, buttons are tactile and the google logo gives it an edge. There is a 'Made in Taiwan' logo also which can be ignored as the font is very small. 2. The software experience of stock Android is simplly superb. It makes u feel easy as there r no unnecessary notifications, ads or apps. 3. The camera is a beast at this price point. The portrait shots are fabulous, low light photos are pretty dynamic yet natural. Image processing takes a tad bit long but produces some amazing shots. 4. Supports all 5g bands. Have tested on Airtel 5G+, and it performed extremely well with download speeds of upto 200 Mbps. 5. The pricing is just about correct for this device if you can get it for 39999. It will be one of the first phones to get Android 14 in which google is planning to do some good things (AI) 6. Face unlock works very good. 7. Multimedia experience is also very good with a vibrant HDR screen and power packed stereo speakers.  CONS: 1. Bezels on the screen make the screen look a bit outdated. 2. It does not come with allways on 90Hz refresh rate for the display. It auto switches between 60 and 90Hz depending on the requirement of the content to be displayed. 3. Battery life is good. Can easily last a day even after heavy usage. But charging at 18 watts is very slow. Can take 3 hrs for a full charge.  Rest assured, the phone looks good. If you have the budget, just go for it. It comes from Google, one of the biggest brands in the world. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Hi, first of all thanks to flipkart for the speedy delivery and delivering it before time. First of all let me start with the looks of the phone, it's a 6.1 inch full HD plus oled display. The colours are just too good. Lets talk about the camera, I think this beats any other smartphone at this price range. Cameras are just flagship level and the colours are so accurate. The speakers quality is top notch too. Now the cons: Dear google this phone feels like a heater releasing heat this summer. I mean fix the heating issue fast. Also the battery drains very fast. Overall its a one handed phone and performance wise its top notch, however the heating issue need to be fixed ASAP\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is very handy and compact. Easy to carry in my pocket. The build quality is very good. Best for photography. Software experience is excellent. The only thing I dislike is that battery backup is not up to the mark. overall fine. If anyone thinks about a compact phone they can go for it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The smartest phone in the world. Google always stays top in terms of cameras and software optimisation. Pixel 7a is the pinnacle of mobile photography. The battery is quite good and it charges fast enough, first time when you will charge it will have a slow charge then after that it is pretty fast if u use the Google charger. No bloatware no ads nothing clean look. #googlepixel #cleanui\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are a Pixel lover then you dont need any reason to buy this one just go for it, However The Pixel 7a is the best mid-range Android phone available. It squeezes even more of the premium smartphone experience into a smaller, cheaper model.  Pros: brilliant camera, excellent smaller screen, top performance, decent battery life, wireless charging, face and fingerprint unlock, water resistance, recycled aluminium and plastic, five years of security updates, Android 13, smart software features, competitively priced.  Cons: no optical zoom or macro photo mode, face unlock option not as secure as some rivals, battery life short of best-in-class, fairly slow charging.\n",

Plenty of options for editing photos and in camera while capturing.Performs good even in low light. Potrait mode is epic. Selfie camera is average. Screen is great,feels very soft. Good blaoteare free software experience. Performance is great. No heating issues Please note this phone is not for the gamers as the battery drains fast compared to other phones in the market. One hand operation is smooth. Battery life is average. One day can be survived with moderate usage. Bezels are visibly big. Phone feels great in hand, aspect ratio is perfect.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Worth it (Post discounted price) Camera and user interface is USP. No issues as reported on network or battery.

Value for money\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Premium looking and buttery smooth response.. Charging is slow but as we know iphones are also not providing much faster charging (for its long life and good battery health). Battery optimization is good. It drains slowly as compared with other devices. The heating issue is there but it doesn't affect its battery. It's not a GAMING PHONE so don't compare it with SD gen1/2. (However my ANTUTU Score is 795666 in 28 degree room temperature) Overall performance is great but AI features are making it unique. In this price you cannot get these features but Google made it possible.  Out of 5 Design - 5 (Metal frame and premium quality plastic back makes it more durable) Display - 4.5 (size - 4, response/appearance - 5) Camera - 5 (night mode is not that good but other features are best) Software - 5 (undoubtedly) Performance - 4 (equivalent to almost SD 888) Battery - 5 Charging - 3.5 Value for money - 5  It's not for Gamers but best for others. Tech people will love it. Hidden features are also there which you will get to know while using it regularly. 🥰🥰🥰\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: This does come with Pixel experience, and that experience has some flaws. Camera and haptic feedback is awesome, other than everything else is a let down.  First hardware flaws. 1. Heats up a lot. Battery drains too fast. 2. Battery alone makes it a phone that's a pain to live with. 3. Performance is also sub par. 4. You'll need a PD/PPS charger to charge it at an acceptable pace.  Software flaws. 1. Video over LTE calls are not supported. That means no Jio video calls, you'll need to use Meet or other apps to make a video call. 2. Call recording is not supported. 3. Switching mobile-data sim is a hassle. You'll need to dive deep into the settings to do that.  Other than all this, phone is ok. But really not worth the price it asks.\n",

Its primary camera captures stunning photos with clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive detail. The phone's low-light performance is exceptional, allowing you to capture memorable moments even in challenging lighting conditions. With its versatile camera modes and settings, including manual mode and AI-enhanced features, this phone caters to a variety of photography styles. Additionally, the front-facing camera delivers excellent selfies with accurate skin tones and sharp details. Overall, pixal 7a is a perfect blend of compactness and excellent camera quality, making it an ideal choice for photography enthusiasts on the go.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Overheating issue. It gets hot way faster than my 6a.  Also, if you scroll slowly, you feel like 60hz is not 60hz at all. Probably might get fixed by software updates.  Apart from these two, it's a good phone but feature wise, not a big jump from 6a.  The camera is a little bit better than the 6a.  If you are planning for a stable phone which runs cool and smooth, i would recommend 6a.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: I bought this phone for camera quality. Photos are great and rendering original color.  But very much disappointment with battery and charging.  I bought original Google charger with this phone. The battery wasn't charging at all. After research in Google I disabled Adaptive charging. After that it started charging. But dead slow. Took 1 hr from 31 to 50% charge.  Heating issue also there. Heats badly like we can't hold the phone in hand.  This is my 1st day observation. Will update after using for few days..  Edit: 2nd day morning charged faster to 100%  Edit 2: Heating issue reduced after 2nd day of use. The battery was draining too fast. Restricted background activities of many Apps helped to reduce the draining speed.  Pros: Awesome camera quality. Accurate color. Low light. Excellent night shot.  Cons: Battery needs to be charged twice a day. Cannot set a separate ringtone for dual sim. Can cast the screen only to Chromecast inbuilt TVs.\n",

Its quite pricey yet not regretful. Really liked the design. Since my previous phone is Pixel 6a, it is quite similar to its look and feel, so I do not feel that much of having a new phone as I did previously when upgrading from 4a to 6a. One thing I notice is (been only using it for 2 days) that it seems the speaker is not better than my 6a. Heating issues? Well, I know there have been so much complaints about the heating issue even before I bought it. But as a casual user, I did not find it a problem till now.  Great phone, glad to be a part of #teampixel. Looking forward to be a Pixel user in the future too😁\n",

Mind it, the phone does get warm or hot sometimes, when u r performing extensive tasks and while using mobile data for a long time.\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: Reviewing it after 3 weeks from purchase. Earlier I was using Redme Note 8 pro so I was expecting better than it but pixel disappointed.  The only good thing is it's built quality and tear camera is average but night mode is really good.  UI is basic you won't like if u come from xiomi. Touch is average sometimes hard to clicks. Poor battery performance make worst, After full charge (without 5g) and without much use it won't long for day. Even if you are watching videos or using camera mobile heats a lot. Personally after spending 35k+ not worth it. Regreating to choose pixel.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Loved it .. haptics is really great... Heats up a bit, but i hope they would fix it in the later updates. Charging is slow. It's fine, it might help us to get a bit organised I guess. 👍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Why u shd get the phone:  if u love taking photos and u love stock Android, get it  What has improved:  the pixel 7 is much faster than how generally we expect a pixel phone to be. Usually pixel phones are much slower compared to flagship but this time Google has nailed it with raw performance.  What to hate about it: 1. The 5g modem in this is garbage. I use it with 5g disabled and on LTE. If u don't disable 5g the phone WILL heat up a lot(the phone is continuously searching for 5g network unless it's disabled in settings)  2. Fingerprint scanner is really annoying (seriously Google? This is 2023)  3. Battery is much less if u compare it to older models. This is not a negative but it's because of the newer better performing processor. Actually if u enable battery saver it does save a lot of battery, especially on mobile data. Using the phone under wifi networks have me sufficient charge.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: A Pixel Perfect Phone 🤳 1 WEEK REVIEW -such a awesome camera (though with updates it will get even better) -design is good 💯 -battery is 5/5 for mixed usage will give a full day backup - performance is good ,no jitters and even 60hz feels smooth enough. - haptics are good 👍 - charging is slow 🦥 but battery last's long so not a big issue.(2HRS WITH NORMAL CHARGER) - 5G connectivity issues are there as of now, (and heating occurs only while using 5G and maps) 4G works just 👍 awesome (these issues should be resolved with temperature going down in India after Summers and with updates too. - the processor is capable enough to run and multi task heavy apps so no worries on the performance part. - besides these things there is nothing to worry, everything is 😎 Awesome.    Will Update after a month  - Feels like adaptive thing really works great according to the usage, satisfied. -update like feature drop does'nt releases for every phone at a time, it's in batches. -heatings get's controlled ig after somedays of usage -Connectivity usage are resolved for me as of now. -Overall, definetly google's ai thing works great.\n",

Initial days heating observed for 2 to 3 days , after regular use I have not observed the heating issue. Since my usage is not that heavy, battery works for me with nominal calling , what's app and video watch for a 9 to 10 hours. Charging takes 1.5 hours for full charge with 18 watt charger.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after using it for a week!  PROS  Camera : 5/5 Camera is the best. It's better than iPhones. My iPhone user friends are appreciating it's camera. However, I'm yet to test the video. I bought it because of it's Camera and looks.  Design: 5/5 Excellent design and looks. iPhones are very common these days and being owner of this unique phone brings sense of pride. People just love my phone when they see it.   CONS  Battery : 4/5 Battery backup is awesome but not that great. Lasts enough just like iPhones. Charges 60% in just an hour which is great enough for me because I never charge my phone to 100%. I don't understand why people are complaining about it.  Fingerprint: 1/5 Fingerprint doesn't work well after recent updates to Android 14. I hope Google find the fix to this issue soon.  Display : Not that great, I guess. Sometimes touch didn't work properly for me. I don't know if I got defective one.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Feels very premium in hand. Day to day tasks are very smooth, Take very good photos. No editing like color enhance or anything is done on the attached photos. Tried playing BGMI, performance was smooth in game almost constant 60 fps but heats up while gaming so you can't play high end games for long.  I got the update the same day I got my phone so I updated it to Android 14, and all the reviews are based on that experience  Heated when I was setting the phone up, which included transferring of app and data from my old phone to this one and during the first 2 updates.  After that i didn't face any issues with the heating in normal usage, still heats on graphic intensive tasks though, but again almost every phone heats up my old realme heats up too and even iqoo 9 Se of my brother but pixel heats up relatively quickly than iQoo 9Se, hell even iPhone 15 pro Max heats up.  Battery backup was below average on the first two days then it started to improve, Google does some ai magic in the background.  Now it can easily handle a day for medium usage. Today itself the screen on time is around 6 hour 10 minutes and it still had 21 % battery left. It has been around 24 hours since I last charged it. I guess it will give around 1.5 hours more SOT.  On the first day it was around 4.5 hours today it will be 7.5-8 hours of SOT. But today I didn't do any graphic intensive task apart from recording a 1080p 60 fps video for around 30 minutes .  And my screen refresh rate is set to smooth 90hz\n",

But unfortunately the phone finger touch sensor useless. When checked with other users about this issue, they reported same thing. Other is heating problem, I really regret putting in few more bucks and buying a more stable and reliable product than this. I think google need to first resolve the basic issues before improving advance issues.\n",

Phone heats up more than normal, but it will be improved later after adjustment. No preinstall boatwares.  Review after using a couple of days. I will update later if there are any drastic changes.  Update: after a few days heating problem solved. May be due to AI as claimed by Google\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: FYI- The cover is not included with the phone. I bought that separately.  The smoothness of the phone, the picture quality and the photo optimization of Google pixel 7a is amazing. We have magic eraser, portrait blur, and long exposure for the photographers of the house. You will definitely love these features if you like taking pictures. Also we get the latest updates first as its Google.\n",

Very easy to use one handed. Camera quality is top notch. You just point and shoot. It would be a very good photo. Charging is kept at 18 watt but that's fine. Battery backup is fine for me. It is giving 5 hours of screen time with normal usage. For this price it is very good upgrade from 6A. If looking for your first pixel device this is a go to phone you can buy it blindly.\n",

Performance - 10/10. This phone performs great in every day tasks. Multitasking and ram management is great. I don't do heavy gaming but you can play games like pubg and cod with no issues.  Battery -8/10. After tweaking some settings, I get about 6 hours of SOT every day. Battery charging is not too slow but not fast either. I get no heating issues till now.  Design - 10/10. I like it's compact design. It's very easy for one hand use. Phone don't feel too big in pocket. Build quality is also great. Plastic on the back mimic like glass and have good quality.  Display 9/10. Display colours are vibrant. Movies look good in this display. Although it struggles when you use in direct sunlight. Display is not bright enough.\n",

It gives me 6 hours of SOT and I get 1.5-2 days from one full charge to another. If you're a light user It'll easily come for 1.5 days, for a medium user it'll last a day. If you're a heavy user and play games constantly, this phone ain't for you. And yes the charging will take almost 2 hours. Overall it's a beautiful phone with a great camera.\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: The phone is pretty in looks but is not at all worth the price tag. They'll have to bring it down to 28-30k like before.  Heating is still a BIG problem, even at 25C ambient temperature, the phone will start heating while doing the most basic stuff like scrolling through IG, video calling, YouTube/Netflix streaming or simply browsing the web. It really becomes uncomfortable to hold.  The camera is not as good as the Pixel 7, which is expected.  The front camera is very very weak in low light, too much noise reduction in video. Loss of details is evident.  Performance is fine, nothing extraordinary, there are lags and frame drops while multi tasking for swiping through heavy apps. It is irritating given the fact that same chip is used in 7 and 7pro. Save your money, spend it elsewhere.\n",

Inbuilt security chip/feature but it doesn't matter if you are using it for daily usage The camera is as good as Google says Inbuilt AI feature and Google apps are best.  The only concern is battery and charging. With a 40-watt/20-watt fast charger, it is taking 6 hours to charge fully. I don't know why Google does this but it is not recommended to use this phone as a primary phone if you travel and mostly away from home\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after a month! The phone is too good, it's so smooth at 90hz and the in hand feel is too premium and also the main thing is it's compact! Camera- it is literally the best at this price range, I had iPhone 13 previously and this pixel takes much better and original colour photos than that! Processor - the processor is good for normal use I tried bgmi and took the hot drop then it lagged like crazy but after 1 min it got stable and I was getting 55-60 fps constant at smooth extreme, though it's not a gaming device, it can run games with decent performance. Battery - The battery is good, it takes approx 1.5 hrs to charge on original Samsung charger, and it drains a little fast while using camera and games but In scrolling, calls, normal tasks it is very great! Display- The display is good and very responsive and pixel animations are so gorgeous but the full brightness feels low in outside conditions! So overall I'd give 4.5/5 to this device, also this phone heated a lot while setting up for the first time and when I upgraded it to Android 14 but after that it has never heated a bit except it gets warm while using camera or games for long time!\n",

The phone hangs alot and gets stuck multiple times\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: As you will see in many reviews: 1) The camera is awesome without any doubt. 2) Battery is OK last whole day with moderate use, but charging is slow. 3) Device heats little on calls, which is not good. But even the iPhone heats on video calls. 4) Screen/Display is awesome, tried increasing little system font. Letter and images are crisp. 5) Face recognition works only in light, which is utterly poor. So I'm just using touch ID which is just fine and secure.  It's been just one month, I'll update later. I got it in replacement with my 2.5 years old iPhone 11 128 GB. For me it's worth it as the camera and screen are far better than the iPhone 11.  A clean Android experience of course.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Camera: best part of the device and in my comparison it's even better then the well known flagships. Battery: if you are heavy user probably you will need to change during the day, else will just make it till the end of the day. Also wait for the device to optimise itself in 2-3 days post first time setup. Charging: this is a bin negative and yes the charging speed is snail pace low...it take literally 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Overheating: does get warm up during hefty usage otherwise it's fine. Also just to draw a comparison, we are mi and realme people compared to it it's not even warm 🤣 Jokes apart yes it gets warm but upon heavy usage and if you have restricted background apps then that too will get resolved. Performance: absolute delight all apps and tasks run butter smooth, not a gamer though but played few light games ran fine. UI experience: flawless...90hz display is not enabled by default but once you enable it...it becomes whole different experience. Display: display is good quality OLED, no complaints but yes little less Max brightness so direct under the sun visibility is good not great.  Finally: would recommend it as it's a great phone and ticks most of the qualities one looks for in a device. Only problem I see is the battery, if your usage is high then this is not the device for you. As battery won't last long and you will stay plugged for a very long time to add some.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Probably the best android phone in terms of user expirience. Lots of things to learn.camera captures real photos. Only issue is phone heating on the side aluminium panel which is really annoying considering its winter in india. I will post another review in a month after heavy gaming.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a good premium stock Android phone.  Battery heats up (when exposed in the direct sun) sometimes and slows down the charging speed.  Otherwise it's a smooth and top notch phone as you expect from a Pixel device.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size phone for a compact phone user. Hazel color looks amazing. It has the best display on a phone in the world(check DXOMark rating). The phone is quick and the touch is amazing! Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness. I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genre😆\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: What you'll like: - Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!! - 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pixel is King👑\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Amazing Phone from Google. Perfect size. Nice colour. All good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall a classy product.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The pixel ever used. 1. Camera - 10/ 10 the biggest Samsung sensors ever which is GN2. 2. Display - 10/10 crisp and 120 hz is fantastic. 3. Design - 10/10 Compact and not able to believe that everything is there. 4. Battery - 9/10 Decent battery.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is an average phone regarding the price. It is not justified with its price.  Pros: 1. Back camera is top notch. 2. Low light photography is awesome. 3. Smooth android experience. 4. Display is good for content consumption. 5. Lil bit gaming is okay. 6. Backside look and colour is very good. Gives Premium feeling.  Cons: 1. Selfie camera is bad. 2. Battery drains quickly some time. 3. I faced charging issue with my old OnePlus Adaptor. 4. Performance is average. 5. The phone gets heat up while changing. 6. Using tempered glass can create smooth typing issues.  If your preference is just for Camera or normal use, You can go for it. Otherwise go for any other brand phones.\n",

Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.\n",

Display - it's too good  Bonus point (TiP) Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.  Please don't go for ambrane charger Will regret like me and ambrane charger don't even give refund.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic 😔.  Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.  Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.\n",

Pros: Camera: picture quality is outstanding with Google processing after capturing makes DSLR like pictures.Edge detection is not perfect in portrait mode.

AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.  Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.  If you are a tech guy and don't play games or not multimedia(YouTube/movie) user just go for it, if you get it less than 40k\n",

Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",

Battery:  charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes by using 30w pd charger (Google).  5 to 6 hours of screen on time.  Performance:  Good for normal users who needs pure android UI and smooth display working.  Cons:  Not good for heavy users .  Not good for gamers .\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: After using it for 2 months, I'm writing this that this phone is good for normal users. This is not for heavy users or gamers. You can get around 4 to 5 hours of screen on time and the charging is bit slow. The display is top notch and the camera is also great. But if you come to performance part and if you are performing normal day-to-day task, you will not have any issues. But as soon as you start doing heavy task it will warm up. Overall Good for normal users\n",

Design and software is fluid compared to 3rd party UIs.Very happy with the camera performance as it's flagship grade alongwith AI integration for editing video n photos. Battery performance is average.Hope future updates improve its performance.Experiencing heating issues during extended usage specially on 5g.If you want to stick to Android, it's the better choice.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great Camera, Great Specs, I'm Switched IPHONE XR to PIXEL 8. Pixel Experience is Brilliant. Worth Buying. Yes, Price is Kind of Higher than other phone. But when u use this device, Then U feel like holding a Real flagship device better than S23 and iPhone 14. Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a good premium stock Android phone.  Battery heats up (when exposed in the direct sun) sometimes and slows down the charging speed.  Otherwise it's a smooth and top notch phone as you expect from a Pixel device.\n",

The phone is quick and the touch is amazing! Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness. I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genre😆\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",

Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!! - 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Well I got it is with exchange of my old phone. Have been using OnePlus devices from last siz years.  This phone has been working fine for me from last 15 days. I saw people talking about battery period. I found it similar to previous phone. Full charge giving me a full day battery as per my usage. The camera is good. Taking beautiful pictures at low light. Other AI features are also fine but haven't used those completely.  Not facing a heating issue as mentioned by many reviews. Overall good huy\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is an average phone regarding the price. It is not justified with its price.  Pros: 1. Back camera is top notch. 2. Low light photography is awesome. 3. Smooth android experience. 4. Display is good for content consumption. 5. Lil bit gaming is okay. 6. Backside look and colour is very good. Gives Premium feeling.  Cons: 1. Selfie camera is bad. 2. Battery drains quickly some time. 3. I faced charging issue with my old OnePlus Adaptor. 4. Performance is average. 5. The phone gets heat up while changing. 6. Using tempered glass can create smooth typing issues.  If your preference is just for Camera or normal use, You can go for it. Otherwise go for any other brand phones.\n",

Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.\n",

Battery - after 90% charge it will give you 1 day battery life easily 4. Design - The Best in world 5. Display - it's too good  Bonus point (TiP) Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.  Please don't go for ambrane charger Will regret like me and ambrane charger don't even give refund.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic 😔.  Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.  Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

But when u use this device, Then U feel like holding a Real flagship device better than S23 and iPhone 14. Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This is a great android phone with excellent camera quality. Pros: Camera: picture quality is outstanding with Google processing after capturing makes DSLR like pictures.Edge detection is not perfect in portrait mode.  UI: very smooth UI you can feel flagship experience in it.  Design: its size is compact and great for single hand usage and it's design is unique. Haptic and vibration is so good .  AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.  Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.  If you are a tech guy and don't play games or not multimedia(YouTube/movie) user just go for it, if you get it less than 40k\n",

From then the phone wasn't heating(sometimes while using camera) . Performance I don't play games so I never felt like there was any performance issues or lags.This is an excellent phone if you are considering to buy a stock android phone around 30-35k\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after 30 days of Usage  - PROS - Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter. - Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",

Display:  The display has a higher refresh rate of 120Hz, providing a smoother visual experience.  Camera:  The camera takes excellent photos, with good low-light performance.  Battery:  charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes by using 30w pd charger (Google).  5 to 6 hours of screen on time.  Performance:  Good for normal users who needs pure android UI and smooth display working.  Cons:  Not good for heavy users .  Not good for gamers .\n",

U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great Camera, Great Specs, I'm Switched IPHONE XR to PIXEL 8. Pixel Experience is Brilliant. Worth Buying. Yes, Price is Kind of Higher than other phone. But when u use this device, Then U feel like holding a Real flagship device better than S23 and iPhone 14. Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.\n",

Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a good premium stock Android phone.  Battery heats up (when exposed in the direct sun) sometimes and slows down the charging speed.  Otherwise it's a smooth and top notch phone as you expect from a Pixel device.\n",

The phone is quick and the touch is amazing! Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness. I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genre😆\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.\n",

Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",

Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Bought it during the big billion sale This is my first premium mobile, liked the design and it's easy for single hand use Display is good, haptics are good Camera is decent ..have not explored too much Heats up during video calls Battery is a big disappointment, have to charge twice a day Don't buy this mobile, thinking it has a 7 yr upgrade and it's premium looks, not worth it And not worth paying 60k plus Premium Chinese phones at 40k are way better\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great Camera, Great Specs, I'm Switched IPHONE XR to PIXEL 8. Pixel Experience is Brilliant. Worth Buying. Yes, Price is Kind of Higher than other phone. But when u use this device, Then U feel like holding a Real flagship device better than S23 and iPhone 14. Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using stock Android for almost 10 years, moto nexus ,in note 2 , Motorola etc.... here are some cons of pixel 8 1)battery doesn't last for full day with moderate use. 2)camera pop up design makes the mobile feel heavier 3)save passwords error as instead of login Id it shows password 4)Gemini ai can do better. Good points Display is just awesome for HDR videos and daily use Sound is good Quick charging for first 50% User friendly interface Camera just tooo good Overall good mobile for daily use but at such price one has more expectations for battery life atleast\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm not sure why there is so much negative talk about the product outside or even in Flipkart reviews about heating My device didn't heat up much yes there is a slight warmth in extensive usage that I observed in the iPhone too  Secondly I liked the pixel because of the AI dude this is way smatter than iPhone in most of the aspects  Finally it's up to you to make a decision If you want a smarter phone way smatter than apple then pixel is best  7 years of software updates and security patch that's insane\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This is a great android phone with excellent camera quality. Pros: Camera: picture quality is outstanding with Google processing after capturing makes DSLR like pictures.Edge detection is not perfect in portrait mode.  UI: very smooth UI you can feel flagship experience in it.  Design: its size is compact and great for single hand usage and it's design is unique. Haptic and vibration is so good .  AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.  Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.  If you are a tech guy and don't play games or not multimedia(YouTube/movie) user just go for it, if you get it less than 40k\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Initially when I received the phone I was disappointed. The phone was heating a lot even when it's in idle then I searched for heating issues and found out there is a adaptive connectivity service process running in the background and disabled it. From then the phone wasn't heating(sometimes while using camera) . Performance I don't play games so I never felt like there was any performance issues or lags.This is an excellent phone if you are considering to buy a stock android phone around 30-35k\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after 30 days of Usage  - PROS - Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter. - Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Design:  The Pixel 8 has a more compact design, making it easier to hold and use one-handed.  Display:  The display has a higher refresh rate of 120Hz, providing a smoother visual experience.  Camera:  The camera takes excellent photos, with good low-light performance.  Battery:  charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes by using 30w pd charger (Google).  5 to 6 hours of screen on time.  Performance:  Good for normal users who needs pure android UI and smooth display working.  Cons:  Not good for heavy users .  Not good for gamers .\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will say if u don't play games and not a very heavy addictive user of phone then u can go blindly for it. The camera never disappoints you the screen makes you fall in love and it's haptic feedback and vibration motor... I will just say I love it ... U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

Google should improve the performance of their phone and service center.  Review after one week - Excessive heating while using Google Maps, Android Auto.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: My first device has damaged and then I got a complete replacement through F1 info solutions. It's been a month of usage, I'm facing serious heating issues and battery draining. Afterall, it's beast especially for camera, vibration motor, crispy display.overall phenomenal experience 😍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Probably the best android phone in terms of user expirience. Lots of things to learn.camera captures real photos.

      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a good premium stock Android phone.  Battery heats up (when exposed in the direct sun) sometimes and slows down the charging speed.  Otherwise it's a smooth and top notch phone as you expect from a Pixel device.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size phone for a compact phone user. Hazel color looks amazing. It has the best display on a phone in the world(check DXOMark rating). The phone is quick and the touch is amazing! Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness. I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genre😆\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: One of the best cameras you can get on Android phones\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: What you'll like: - Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!! - 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pixel is King👑\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Amazing Phone from Google. Perfect size. Nice colour. All good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall a classy product.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The pixel ever used. 1. Camera - 10/ 10 the biggest Samsung sensors ever which is GN2. 2. Display - 10/10 crisp and 120 hz is fantastic. 3. Design - 10/10 Compact and not able to believe that everything is there. 4. Battery - 9/10 Decent battery.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is an average phone regarding the price. It is not justified with its price.  Pros: 1. Back camera is top notch. 2. Low light photography is awesome. 3. Smooth android experience. 4. Display is good for content consumption. 5. Lil bit gaming is okay. 6. Backside look and colour is very good. Gives Premium feeling.  Cons: 1. Selfie camera is bad. 2. Battery drains quickly some time. 3. I faced charging issue with my old OnePlus Adaptor. 4. Performance is average. 5. The phone gets heat up while changing. 6. Using tempered glass can create smooth typing issues.  If your preference is just for Camera or normal use, You can go for it. Otherwise go for any other brand phones.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's too early for review but this is based on first few days experience. 7 years of OS and security updates was pleasant and unexpected. I was a fan since Nexus series but now with the Pixel series specifically Pixel 8 they did a major upgrade complementing with AI and photography. Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.\n",

Display - it's too good  Bonus point (TiP) Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.  Please don't go for ambrane charger Will regret like me and ambrane charger don't even give refund.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic 😔.  Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.  Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this.

Pros: Camera: picture quality is outstanding with Google processing after capturing makes DSLR like pictures.Edge detection is not perfect in portrait mode.

AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.  Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.  If you are a tech guy and don't play games or not multimedia(YouTube/movie) user just go for it, if you get it less than 40k\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after 30 days of Usage  - PROS - Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter. - Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Design:  The Pixel 8 has a more compact design, making it easier to hold and use one-handed.

Battery:  charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes by using 30w pd charger (Google).  5 to 6 hours of screen on time.  Performance:  Good for normal users who needs pure android UI and smooth display working.  Cons:  Not good for heavy users .  Not good for gamers .\n",

U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.\n",

Will gets warm when doing any heavy task and playing games.You need to use the phone with a back cover to avoid the body heating issue.  Display,Sound and design is good. Quiet handy phone. Camera clarity is good but zooming is missing in the phone. Strictly for users who love pixel experience others please stay out and better go with other better options\n",

Battery backup is ok,if you are a normal user. Charging is faster with Google 30 w adapter.Not to be recommended for gamers. Overall performance is very good. Certainly you should go for it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

Camera Os Display Chip(not for extreme gaming) - optimized with os makes a better user experience. The chip delivers near flagship grade performance. But not the best chip for long gaming sessions  Cons  Charging time is a high  Heating is Normal but some times it heats a little. Maybe it's because of the two x1 chip design and the x1 is an ML powerhouse which is a big part of a Google design\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: When you go with Google as a brand, of course you want performance with premium touch, which pixel 7A does provide without a doubt.  1. Camera is 10/10 2. The battery is good as of now, and will improve as it studies usage patterns and makes adjustments in background apps. 3. Design is awesome, the colour is awesome. The body is light weight but strong and durable. 4. 90Hz refresh rate, it doesn't feel like it is lacking 120Hz at all. Its smooth as Cream. 5. There is a little heat issue specially on left edge. 6. Tensor G2 processor, didn't really tried gaming, but multitasking is easy and chill. 7. For charging there is an adaptive mode which slows charging, switched it off and was charging fine, 30 minutes to 50-60% battery.\n",

If anyone is looking for this details but 7 back cover fits fine and custom cut screen protector for Samsung A52 also works for the time being.

First let's talk about problems. 1) Heating little more than other phones in this range.  2) Hanging, I am seeing extreme level of hanging in this phone. Recently I took a screenshot and the phone just hang there and nothing was working, after some try I used voice assistant to power off my device and now it works perfectly normal. I'm afraid this issue can be repeated.  3) network problem, and this one is very common in pixel 7 series phones.  Other than that everything works just fine and I'm happy about it. But Google has failed to solved some basic issues like hanging, network issues and battery life.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I loved this! The camera is a beast if you know how to use it. Performance is also good for the price. The features are loaded in this phone that's something wow!! Overall best mid range yet flagship phone I would say. Camera is a top notch at this range of mobiles!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very nice camera 📸🤩\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Phone design is good. Stock android works smoothly. Camera is awesome. But No pro mode in camera. 😐  Problem - As mentioned by others, heating issue is there in the side panels. I hope Google will fix the issue.  Update: Disabled Adaptive Charging option, reduced the heating issue. Setup - Battery - Adaptive preferences - Disable Adaptive Battery.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great camera , good battery ( sometimes stays for more than a day), great software and best overall experience if you don't consider gaming as this heats up alot but without gaming it's best as per daily uses and multi tasking with loads of ai.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Superb, phone of google pixel A series\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Was one of the first ones to purchase Pixel 7a Snow White. Its a perfect pocket friendly, premium android smartphone that one can ask for. I got it for 39999 which might not be the final price (as price generally drops for pixel mid range phones in a couple of months). Let me list down pros and cons below:  PROS: 1. The device feels good in ur hand. Its compact, color coding is good, buttons are tactile and the google logo gives it an edge. There is a 'Made in Taiwan' logo also which can be ignored as the font is very small. 2. The software experience of stock Android is simplly superb. It makes u feel easy as there r no unnecessary notifications, ads or apps. 3. The camera is a beast at this price point. The portrait shots are fabulous, low light photos are pretty dynamic yet natural. Image processing takes a tad bit long but produces some amazing shots. 4. Supports all 5g bands. Have tested on Airtel 5G+, and it performed extremely well with download speeds of upto 200 Mbps. 5. The pricing is just about correct for this device if you can get it for 39999. It will be one of the first phones to get Android 14 in which google is planning to do some good things (AI) 6. Face unlock works very good. 7. Multimedia experience is also very good with a vibrant HDR screen and power packed stereo speakers.  CONS: 1. Bezels on the screen make the screen look a bit outdated. 2. It does not come with allways on 90Hz refresh rate for the display. It auto switches between 60 and 90Hz depending on the requirement of the content to be displayed. 3. Battery life is good. Can easily last a day even after heavy usage. But charging at 18 watts is very slow. Can take 3 hrs for a full charge.  Rest assured, the phone looks good. If you have the budget, just go for it. It comes from Google, one of the biggest brands in the world. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Hi, first of all thanks to flipkart for the speedy delivery and delivering it before time. First of all let me start with the looks of the phone, it's a 6.1 inch full HD plus oled display. The colours are just too good. Lets talk about the camera, I think this beats any other smartphone at this price range. Cameras are just flagship level and the colours are so accurate. The speakers quality is top notch too. Now the cons: Dear google this phone feels like a heater releasing heat this summer. I mean fix the heating issue fast. Also the battery drains very fast. Overall its a one handed phone and performance wise its top notch, however the heating issue need to be fixed ASAP\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is very handy and compact. Easy to carry in my pocket. The build quality is very good. Best for photography. Software experience is excellent. The only thing I dislike is that battery backup is not up to the mark. overall fine. If anyone thinks about a compact phone they can go for it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The smartest phone in the world. Google always stays top in terms of cameras and software optimisation. Pixel 7a is the pinnacle of mobile photography. The battery is quite good and it charges fast enough, first time when you will charge it will have a slow charge then after that it is pretty fast if u use the Google charger. No bloatware no ads nothing clean look. #googlepixel #cleanui\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are a Pixel lover then you dont need any reason to buy this one just go for it, However The Pixel 7a is the best mid-range Android phone available. It squeezes even more of the premium smartphone experience into a smaller, cheaper model.  Pros: brilliant camera, excellent smaller screen, top performance, decent battery life, wireless charging, face and fingerprint unlock, water resistance, recycled aluminium and plastic, five years of security updates, Android 13, smart software features, competitively priced.  Cons: no optical zoom or macro photo mode, face unlock option not as secure as some rivals, battery life short of best-in-class, fairly slow charging.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Pros: 1)Good clean Android UI experience 2)good camera 3)Google updates  Cons: 1)phone heats up temperature 40DegC 2)battery drains fast need to charge frequently 3)Connectivity is very bad results in call drop no Internet  Final verdict waste for money\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: 4/5 overall rating. Great phone for camera lovers. Google does a great job at post processing photos. Plenty of options for editing photos and in camera while capturing.Performs good even in low light. Potrait mode is epic. Selfie camera is average. Screen is great,feels very soft. Good blaoteare free software experience. Performance is great. No heating issues Please note this phone is not for the gamers as the battery drains fast compared to other phones in the market. One hand operation is smooth. Battery life is average. One day can be survived with moderate usage. Bezels are visibly big. Phone feels great in hand, aspect ratio is perfect.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Worth it (Post discounted price) Camera and user interface is USP. No issues as reported on network or battery. Call quality is very good and battery last a full day (3-4 hours screen time - watching videos/playing games will drain... obviously). Can't say con but yes, battery charging take a bit long...but, it's fine.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Using Google phones since 2014. Upgraded from pixel 5 to pixel 7A. Best camera sensor so far. Speakers loud and clear. Touch haptics are fabulous. Smooth and responsive touch. Display good. Face unlock works fast and perfect. Very handy. Wireless charging quite slow. No lags while playing heavy games. No heating issues. No bloatwares. Value for money\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Premium looking and buttery smooth response.. Charging is slow but as we know iphones are also not providing much faster charging (for its long life and good battery health). Battery optimization is good. It drains slowly as compared with other devices. The heating issue is there but it doesn't affect its battery. It's not a GAMING PHONE so don't compare it with SD gen1/2. (However my ANTUTU Score is 795666 in 28 degree room temperature) Overall performance is great but AI features are making it unique. In this price you cannot get these features but Google made it possible.  Out of 5 Design - 5 (Metal frame and premium quality plastic back makes it more durable) Display - 4.5 (size - 4, response/appearance - 5) Camera - 5 (night mode is not that good but other features are best) Software - 5 (undoubtedly) Performance - 4 (equivalent to almost SD 888) Battery - 5 Charging - 3.5 Value for money - 5  It's not for Gamers but best for others. Tech people will love it. Hidden features are also there which you will get to know while using it regularly. 🥰🥰🥰\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Best phone at its price point. Awesome camera and flawless software experience. No complaints of heating and battery drain after upgrading to Android 14. Premium built quality and haptic feedback. Call quality and network reception is top-notch. Totally loving the coral colour\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Buy for camera and software experience. Needs to improve on screen quality.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: This does come with Pixel experience, and that experience has some flaws. Camera and haptic feedback is awesome, other than everything else is a let down.  First hardware flaws. 1. Heats up a lot. Battery drains too fast. 2. Battery alone makes it a phone that's a pain to live with. 3. Performance is also sub par. 4. You'll need a PD/PPS charger to charge it at an acceptable pace.  Software flaws. 1. Video over LTE calls are not supported. That means no Jio video calls, you'll need to use Meet or other apps to make a video call. 2. Call recording is not supported. 3. Switching mobile-data sim is a hassle. You'll need to dive deep into the settings to do that.  Other than all this, phone is ok. But really not worth the price it asks.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: GOOGLE PIXEL 7 A MONEY WORTH THIS PRODUCT 1, Camera superb 2,Operating very smooth 3,Processor is good 4,Display very nice Some issue google pls take care of battery charging issue, and this product is not fast charging, pls improve that,\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pixal 7a (sea,128) is a remarkable device that combines top-notch camera quality with a compact and portable design. Its primary camera captures stunning photos with clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive detail. The phone's low-light performance is exceptional, allowing you to capture memorable moments even in challenging lighting conditions. With its versatile camera modes and settings, including manual mode and AI-enhanced features, this phone caters to a variety of photography styles. Additionally, the front-facing camera delivers excellent selfies with accurate skin tones and sharp details. Overall, pixal 7a is a perfect blend of compactness and excellent camera quality, making it an ideal choice for photography enthusiasts on the go.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Overheating issue. It gets hot way faster than my 6a.  Also, if you scroll slowly, you feel like 60hz is not 60hz at all. Probably might get fixed by software updates.  Apart from these two, it's a good phone but feature wise, not a big jump from 6a.  The camera is a little bit better than the 6a.  If you are planning for a stable phone which runs cool and smooth, i would recommend 6a.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If u will leave heating issues I must say it is a new love..\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: I bought this phone for camera quality. Photos are great and rendering original color.  But very much disappointment with battery and charging.  I bought original Google charger with this phone. The battery wasn't charging at all. After research in Google I disabled Adaptive charging. After that it started charging. But dead slow. Took 1 hr from 31 to 50% charge.  Heating issue also there. Heats badly like we can't hold the phone in hand.  This is my 1st day observation. Will update after using for few days..  Edit: 2nd day morning charged faster to 100%  Edit 2: Heating issue reduced after 2nd day of use. The battery was draining too fast. Restricted background activities of many Apps helped to reduce the draining speed.  Pros: Awesome camera quality. Accurate color. Low light. Excellent night shot.  Cons: Battery needs to be charged twice a day. Cannot set a separate ringtone for dual sim. Can cast the screen only to Chromecast inbuilt TVs.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This is my 3rd Pixel phone, have bought 4a, 6a previously. Although pixel phones doesn't do well Indian Market, I am happy that it is available through flipkart. Its quite pricey yet not regretful. Really liked the design. Since my previous phone is Pixel 6a, it is quite similar to its look and feel, so I do not feel that much of having a new phone as I did previously when upgrading from 4a to 6a. One thing I notice is (been only using it for 2 days) that it seems the speaker is not better than my 6a. Heating issues? Well, I know there have been so much complaints about the heating issue even before I bought it. But as a casual user, I did not find it a problem till now.  Great phone, glad to be a part of #teampixel. Looking forward to be a Pixel user in the future too😁\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has done a good job with the build quality and phones also run smoothly in daily usage... But as I have heard of the heating issues on social media platforms, yes heating is an issue and it's quite odd that it tends to get warm on even very light usage.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The good: 1. The camera- takes accurate photos in all lights 2. The pixel UI- Addictive, it knows what you want. Bugs are lesser than other skin 3. Performance- not the best, but you won't complain  The bad: 1. Battery: drains faster 2. Charging speed 3. Bezels\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: If you are a casual user, looking for a camera centric phone with a clean and smooth user interface, compact design. Blindly go for it, bang for the bucks.  Limitations: If you are okay with slow charging, this phone should not bother you. Mind it, the phone does get warm or hot sometimes, when u r performing extensive tasks and while using mobile data for a long time.\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: Reviewing it after 3 weeks from purchase. Earlier I was using Redme Note 8 pro so I was expecting better than it but pixel disappointed.  The only good thing is it's built quality and tear camera is average but night mode is really good.  UI is basic you won't like if u come from xiomi. Touch is average sometimes hard to clicks. Poor battery performance make worst, After full charge (without 5g) and without much use it won't long for day. Even if you are watching videos or using camera mobile heats a lot. Personally after spending 35k+ not worth it. Regreating to choose pixel.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Loved it .. haptics is really great... Heats up a bit, but i hope they would fix it in the later updates. Charging is slow. It's fine, it might help us to get a bit organised I guess. 👍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Why u shd get the phone:  if u love taking photos and u love stock Android, get it  What has improved:  the pixel 7 is much faster than how generally we expect a pixel phone to be. Usually pixel phones are much slower compared to flagship but this time Google has nailed it with raw performance.  What to hate about it: 1. The 5g modem in this is garbage. I use it with 5g disabled and on LTE. If u don't disable 5g the phone WILL heat up a lot(the phone is continuously searching for 5g network unless it's disabled in settings)  2. Fingerprint scanner is really annoying (seriously Google? This is 2023)  3. Battery is much less if u compare it to older models. This is not a negative but it's because of the newer better performing processor. Actually if u enable battery saver it does save a lot of battery, especially on mobile data. Using the phone under wifi networks have me sufficient charge.\n",

Will Update after a month  - Feels like adaptive thing really works great according to the usage, satisfied. -update like feature drop does'nt releases for every phone at a time, it's in batches. -heatings get's controlled ig after somedays of usage -Connectivity usage are resolved for me as of now. -Overall, definetly google's ai thing works great.\n",

Initial days heating observed for 2 to 3 days , after regular use I have not observed the heating issue. Since my usage is not that heavy, battery works for me with nominal calling , what's app and video watch for a 9 to 10 hours. Charging takes 1.5 hours for full charge with 18 watt charger.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after using it for a week!  PROS  Camera : 5/5 Camera is the best. It's better than iPhones. My iPhone user friends are appreciating it's camera. However, I'm yet to test the video. I bought it because of it's Camera and looks.  Design: 5/5 Excellent design and looks. iPhones are very common these days and being owner of this unique phone brings sense of pride. People just love my phone when they see it.   CONS  Battery : 4/5 Battery backup is awesome but not that great. Lasts enough just like iPhones. Charges 60% in just an hour which is great enough for me because I never charge my phone to 100%. I don't understand why people are complaining about it.  Fingerprint: 1/5 Fingerprint doesn't work well after recent updates to Android 14. I hope Google find the fix to this issue soon.  Display : Not that great, I guess. Sometimes touch didn't work properly for me. I don't know if I got defective one.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Feels very premium in hand. Day to day tasks are very smooth, Take very good photos. No editing like color enhance or anything is done on the attached photos. Tried playing BGMI, performance was smooth in game almost constant 60 fps but heats up while gaming so you can't play high end games for long.  I got the update the same day I got my phone so I updated it to Android 14, and all the reviews are based on that experience  Heated when I was setting the phone up, which included transferring of app and data from my old phone to this one and during the first 2 updates.  After that i didn't face any issues with the heating in normal usage, still heats on graphic intensive tasks though, but again almost every phone heats up my old realme heats up too and even iqoo 9 Se of my brother but pixel heats up relatively quickly than iQoo 9Se, hell even iPhone 15 pro Max heats up.  Battery backup was below average on the first two days then it started to improve, Google does some ai magic in the background.  Now it can easily handle a day for medium usage. Today itself the screen on time is around 6 hour 10 minutes and it still had 21 % battery left. It has been around 24 hours since I last charged it. I guess it will give around 1.5 hours more SOT.  On the first day it was around 4.5 hours today it will be 7.5-8 hours of SOT. But today I didn't do any graphic intensive task apart from recording a 1080p 60 fps video for around 30 minutes .  And my screen refresh rate is set to smooth 90hz\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Purchased this phone trusted the name of google. In the hope, maybe they will be competitive and will make phones like apple. But unfortunately the phone finger touch sensor useless. When checked with other users about this issue, they reported same thing. Other is heating problem, I really regret putting in few more bucks and buying a more stable and reliable product than this. I think google need to first resolve the basic issues before improving advance issues.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Best choice in the Android segment. The camera is very good, and the battery lasts for 24 hr for me in moderate use. Phone heats up more than normal, but it will be improved later after adjustment. No preinstall boatwares.  Review after using a couple of days. I will update later if there are any drastic changes.  Update: after a few days heating problem solved. May be due to AI as claimed by Google\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: FYI- The cover is not included with the phone. I bought that separately.  The smoothness of the phone, the picture quality and the photo optimization of Google pixel 7a is amazing. We have magic eraser, portrait blur, and long exposure for the photographers of the house. You will definitely love these features if you like taking pictures. Also we get the latest updates first as its Google.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first pixel device and I would say that the build quality is very good. No loose frame or cracking sound. Very compact phone with 6.1 inch screen. Very easy to use one handed. Camera quality is top notch. You just point and shoot. It would be a very good photo. Charging is kept at 18 watt but that's fine. Battery backup is fine for me. It is giving 5 hours of screen time with normal usage. For this price it is very good upgrade from 6A. If looking for your first pixel device this is a go to phone you can buy it blindly.\n",

It gives me 6 hours of SOT and I get 1.5-2 days from one full charge to another. If you're a light user It'll easily come for 1.5 days, for a medium user it'll last a day. If you're a heavy user and play games constantly, this phone ain't for you. And yes the charging will take almost 2 hours. Overall it's a beautiful phone with a great camera.\n",

Bad Haptics motor: can hardly feel the haptics even on max vibration strength. Coming from 5a it felt like a big bummer.   Pros: 1.

Battery lasts hardly 1 full day (You may need to charge in between also) 3. Charging speed can be better  Pros - 1. Good design - May not be made of premium material but doesn't feel cheap at all. 2. Great OLED screen with 90 Hz refresh rate 3. Great camera - No description needed 4. Welcome wireless charging - in primitive stage though 5. Great software user experience I only wish having a double click to sleep and wake up facility available\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: The phone is pretty in looks but is not at all worth the price tag. They'll have to bring it down to 28-30k like before.  Heating is still a BIG problem, even at 25C ambient temperature, the phone will start heating while doing the most basic stuff like scrolling through IG, video calling, YouTube/Netflix streaming or simply browsing the web. It really becomes uncomfortable to hold.  The camera is not as good as the Pixel 7, which is expected.  The front camera is very very weak in low light, too much noise reduction in video. Loss of details is evident.  Performance is fine, nothing extraordinary, there are lags and frame drops while multi tasking for swiping through heavy apps. It is irritating given the fact that same chip is used in 7 and 7pro. Save your money, spend it elsewhere.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Recently purchased this pixel. Overall a good product in this range. Pure Android. The display is good. Inbuilt security chip/feature but it doesn't matter if you are using it for daily usage The camera is as good as Google says Inbuilt AI feature and Google apps are best.  The only concern is battery and charging. With a 40-watt/20-watt fast charger, it is taking 6 hours to charge fully. I don't know why Google does this but it is not recommended to use this phone as a primary phone if you travel and mostly away from home\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after a month! The phone is too good, it's so smooth at 90hz and the in hand feel is too premium and also the main thing is it's compact! Camera- it is literally the best at this price range, I had iPhone 13 previously and this pixel takes much better and original colour photos than that! Processor - the processor is good for normal use I tried bgmi and took the hot drop then it lagged like crazy but after 1 min it got stable and I was getting 55-60 fps constant at smooth extreme, though it's not a gaming device, it can run games with decent performance. Battery - The battery is good, it takes approx 1.5 hrs to charge on original Samsung charger, and it drains a little fast while using camera and games but In scrolling, calls, normal tasks it is very great! Display- The display is good and very responsive and pixel animations are so gorgeous but the full brightness feels low in outside conditions! So overall I'd give 4.5/5 to this device, also this phone heated a lot while setting up for the first time and when I upgraded it to Android 14 but after that it has never heated a bit except it gets warm while using camera or games for long time!\n",

I am an average user but still the battery drains very quickly, even after charging it all night in steady mode, it drains in half day only. Performance is also ok. The phone hangs alot and gets stuck multiple times\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: As you will see in many reviews: 1) The camera is awesome without any doubt. 2) Battery is OK last whole day with moderate use, but charging is slow. 3) Device heats little on calls, which is not good. But even the iPhone heats on video calls. 4) Screen/Display is awesome, tried increasing little system font. Letter and images are crisp. 5) Face recognition works only in light, which is utterly poor. So I'm just using touch ID which is just fine and secure.  It's been just one month, I'll update later. I got it in replacement with my 2.5 years old iPhone 11 128 GB. For me it's worth it as the camera and screen are far better than the iPhone 11.  A clean Android experience of course.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best mobile to use and user friendly mobile\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Camera: best part of the device and in my comparison it's even better then the well known flagships. Battery: if you are heavy user probably you will need to change during the day, else will just make it till the end of the day. Also wait for the device to optimise itself in 2-3 days post first time setup. Charging: this is a bin negative and yes the charging speed is snail pace low...it take literally 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Overheating: does get warm up during hefty usage otherwise it's fine. Also just to draw a comparison, we are mi and realme people compared to it it's not even warm 🤣 Jokes apart yes it gets warm but upon heavy usage and if you have restricted background apps then that too will get resolved. Performance: absolute delight all apps and tasks run butter smooth, not a gamer though but played few light games ran fine. UI experience: flawless...90hz display is not enabled by default but once you enable it...it becomes whole different experience. Display: display is good quality OLED, no complaints but yes little less Max brightness so direct under the sun visibility is good not great.  Finally: would recommend it as it's a great phone and ticks most of the qualities one looks for in a device. Only problem I see is the battery, if your usage is high then this is not the device for you. As battery won't last long and you will stay plugged for a very long time to add some.\n",

(AI optimizes battery as per user's usage) no network issue found yet .. call quality is very good till now as compared to pixel 4a. phones heats up during first set up but after andriod 14 update no such heavy heating observed.  cons: thick bezel. charging is a bit slow.  so all those youtuber's who gave negetive feedback either did not get paid by google or the issues has been fixed by google with OTA updates.\n",

Have used Costar 33w fast charger to charge Pixel7a by 40% in 35 mins. Live Captions on voice call is great feature !!!

Camera Os Display Chip(not for extreme gaming) - optimized with os makes a better user experience. The chip delivers near flagship grade performance. But not the best chip for long gaming sessions  Cons  Charging time is a high  Heating is Normal but some times it heats a little. Maybe it's because of the two x1 chip design and the x1 is an ML powerhouse which is a big part of a Google design\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: When you go with Google as a brand, of course you want performance with premium touch, which pixel 7A does provide without a doubt.  1. Camera is 10/10 2. The battery is good as of now, and will improve as it studies usage patterns and makes adjustments in background apps. 3. Design is awesome, the colour is awesome. The body is light weight but strong and durable. 4. 90Hz refresh rate, it doesn't feel like it is lacking 120Hz at all. Its smooth as Cream. 5. There is a little heat issue specially on left edge. 6. Tensor G2 processor, didn't really tried gaming, but multitasking is easy and chill. 7. For charging there is an adaptive mode which slows charging, switched it off and was charging fine, 30 minutes to 50-60% battery.\n",

If anyone is looking for this details but 7 back cover fits fine and custom cut screen protector for Samsung A52 also works for the time being. I was waiting for this for last 3 months so I am little biased but all there is not a single thing in this phone that makes it a deal breaker..\n",

Recently I took a screenshot and the phone just hang there and nothing was working, after some try I used voice assistant to power off my device and now it works perfectly normal. I'm afraid this issue can be repeated.  3) network problem, and this one is very common in pixel 7 series phones.  Other than that everything works just fine and I'm happy about it.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Superb, phone of google pixel A series\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Was one of the first ones to purchase Pixel 7a Snow White. Its a perfect pocket friendly, premium android smartphone that one can ask for. I got it for 39999 which might not be the final price (as price generally drops for pixel mid range phones in a couple of months). Let me list down pros and cons below:  PROS: 1. The device feels good in ur hand. Its compact, color coding is good, buttons are tactile and the google logo gives it an edge. There is a 'Made in Taiwan' logo also which can be ignored as the font is very small. 2. The software experience of stock Android is simplly superb. It makes u feel easy as there r no unnecessary notifications, ads or apps. 3. The camera is a beast at this price point. The portrait shots are fabulous, low light photos are pretty dynamic yet natural. Image processing takes a tad bit long but produces some amazing shots. 4. Supports all 5g bands. Have tested on Airtel 5G+, and it performed extremely well with download speeds of upto 200 Mbps. 5. The pricing is just about correct for this device if you can get it for 39999. It will be one of the first phones to get Android 14 in which google is planning to do some good things (AI) 6. Face unlock works very good. 7. Multimedia experience is also very good with a vibrant HDR screen and power packed stereo speakers.  CONS: 1. Bezels on the screen make the screen look a bit outdated. 2. It does not come with allways on 90Hz refresh rate for the display. It auto switches between 60 and 90Hz depending on the requirement of the content to be displayed. 3. Battery life is good. Can easily last a day even after heavy usage. But charging at 18 watts is very slow. Can take 3 hrs for a full charge.  Rest assured, the phone looks good. If you have the budget, just go for it. It comes from Google, one of the biggest brands in the world. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Hi, first of all thanks to flipkart for the speedy delivery and delivering it before time. First of all let me start with the looks of the phone, it's a 6.1 inch full HD plus oled display. The colours are just too good. Lets talk about the camera, I think this beats any other smartphone at this price range. Cameras are just flagship level and the colours are so accurate. The speakers quality is top notch too. Now the cons: Dear google this phone feels like a heater releasing heat this summer. I mean fix the heating issue fast. Also the battery drains very fast. Overall its a one handed phone and performance wise its top notch, however the heating issue need to be fixed ASAP\n",

Pros: brilliant camera, excellent smaller screen, top performance, decent battery life, wireless charging, face and fingerprint unlock, water resistance, recycled aluminium and plastic, five years of security updates, Android 13, smart software features, competitively priced.  Cons: no optical zoom or macro photo mode, face unlock option not as secure as some rivals, battery life short of best-in-class, fairly slow charging.\n",

Good blaoteare free software experience. Performance is great. No heating issues Please note this phone is not for the gamers as the battery drains fast compared to other phones in the market.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Premium looking and buttery smooth response.. Charging is slow but as we know iphones are also not providing much faster charging (for its long life and good battery health). Battery optimization is good. It drains slowly as compared with other devices. The heating issue is there but it doesn't affect its battery. It's not a GAMING PHONE so don't compare it with SD gen1/2. (However my ANTUTU Score is 795666 in 28 degree room temperature) Overall performance is great but AI features are making it unique. In this price you cannot get these features but Google made it possible.  Out of 5 Design - 5 (Metal frame and premium quality plastic back makes it more durable) Display - 4.5 (size - 4, response/appearance - 5) Camera - 5 (night mode is not that good but other features are best) Software - 5 (undoubtedly) Performance - 4 (equivalent to almost SD 888) Battery - 5 Charging - 3.5 Value for money - 5  It's not for Gamers but best for others. Tech people will love it. Hidden features are also there which you will get to know while using it regularly. 🥰🥰🥰\n",

First hardware flaws. 1. Heats up a lot. Battery drains too fast. 2. Battery alone makes it a phone that's a pain to live with. 3. Performance is also sub par. 4. You'll need a PD/PPS charger to charge it at an acceptable pace.  Software flaws. 1. Video over LTE calls are not supported. That means no Jio video calls, you'll need to use Meet or other apps to make a video call. 2. Call recording is not supported. 3. Switching mobile-data sim is a hassle. You'll need to dive deep into the settings to do that.  Other than all this, phone is ok. But really not worth the price it asks.\n",

Apart from these two, it's a good phone but feature wise, not a big jump from 6a.  The camera is a little bit better than the 6a.  If you are planning for a stable phone which runs cool and smooth, i would recommend 6a.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: I bought this phone for camera quality. Photos are great and rendering original color.  But very much disappointment with battery and charging.  I bought original Google charger with this phone. The battery wasn't charging at all. After research in Google I disabled Adaptive charging. After that it started charging. But dead slow. Took 1 hr from 31 to 50% charge.  Heating issue also there. Heats badly like we can't hold the phone in hand.  This is my 1st day observation. Will update after using for few days..  Edit: 2nd day morning charged faster to 100%  Edit 2: Heating issue reduced after 2nd day of use. The battery was draining too fast. Restricted background activities of many Apps helped to reduce the draining speed.  Pros: Awesome camera quality. Accurate color. Low light. Excellent night shot.  Cons: Battery needs to be charged twice a day. Cannot set a separate ringtone for dual sim. Can cast the screen only to Chromecast inbuilt TVs.\n",

Since my previous phone is Pixel 6a, it is quite similar to its look and feel, so I do not feel that much of having a new phone as I did previously when upgrading from 4a to 6a. One thing I notice is (been only using it for 2 days) that it seems the speaker is not better than my 6a. Heating issues? Well, I know there have been so much complaints about the heating issue even before I bought it. But as a casual user, I did not find it a problem till now.  Great phone, glad to be a part of #teampixel. Looking forward to be a Pixel user in the future too😁\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has done a good job with the build quality and phones also run smoothly in daily usage... But as I have heard of the heating issues on social media platforms, yes heating is an issue and it's quite odd that it tends to get warm on even very light usage.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The good: 1. The camera- takes accurate photos in all lights 2. The pixel UI- Addictive, it knows what you want. Bugs are lesser than other skin 3. Performance- not the best, but you won't complain  The bad: 1. Battery: drains faster 2. Charging speed 3. Bezels\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: If you are a casual user, looking for a camera centric phone with a clean and smooth user interface, compact design. Blindly go for it, bang for the bucks.  Limitations: If you are okay with slow charging, this phone should not bother you. Mind it, the phone does get warm or hot sometimes, when u r performing extensive tasks and while using mobile data for a long time.\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: Reviewing it after 3 weeks from purchase. Earlier I was using Redme Note 8 pro so I was expecting better than it but pixel disappointed.  The only good thing is it's built quality and tear camera is average but night mode is really good.  UI is basic you won't like if u come from xiomi. Touch is average sometimes hard to clicks. Poor battery performance make worst, After full charge (without 5g) and without much use it won't long for day. Even if you are watching videos or using camera mobile heats a lot. Personally after spending 35k+ not worth it. Regreating to choose pixel.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Loved it .. haptics is really great... Heats up a bit, but i hope they would fix it in the later updates. Charging is slow. It's fine, it might help us to get a bit organised I guess. 👍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Why u shd get the phone:  if u love taking photos and u love stock Android, get it  What has improved:  the pixel 7 is much faster than how generally we expect a pixel phone to be. Usually pixel phones are much slower compared to flagship but this time Google has nailed it with raw performance.  What to hate about it: 1. The 5g modem in this is garbage. I use it with 5g disabled and on LTE. If u don't disable 5g the phone WILL heat up a lot(the phone is continuously searching for 5g network unless it's disabled in settings)  2. Fingerprint scanner is really annoying (seriously Google? This is 2023)  3. Battery is much less if u compare it to older models. This is not a negative but it's because of the newer better performing processor. Actually if u enable battery saver it does save a lot of battery, especially on mobile data. Using the phone under wifi networks have me sufficient charge.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: A Pixel Perfect Phone 🤳 1 WEEK REVIEW -such a awesome camera (though with updates it will get even better) -design is good 💯 -battery is 5/5 for mixed usage will give a full day backup - performance is good ,no jitters and even 60hz feels smooth enough. - haptics are good 👍 - charging is slow 🦥 but battery last's long so not a big issue.(2HRS WITH NORMAL CHARGER) - 5G connectivity issues are there as of now, (and heating occurs only while using 5G and maps) 4G works just 👍 awesome (these issues should be resolved with temperature going down in India after Summers and with updates too. - the processor is capable enough to run and multi task heavy apps so no worries on the performance part. - besides these things there is nothing to worry, everything is 😎 Awesome.    Will Update after a month  - Feels like adaptive thing really works great according to the usage, satisfied. -update like feature drop does'nt releases for every phone at a time, it's in batches. -heatings get's controlled ig after somedays of usage -Connectivity usage are resolved for me as of now. -Overall, definetly google's ai thing works great.\n",

Initial days heating observed for 2 to 3 days , after regular use I have not observed the heating issue. Since my usage is not that heavy, battery works for me with nominal calling , what's app and video watch for a 9 to 10 hours. Charging takes 1.5 hours for full charge with 18 watt charger.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after using it for a week!  PROS  Camera : 5/5 Camera is the best. It's better than iPhones. My iPhone user friends are appreciating it's camera. However, I'm yet to test the video. I bought it because of it's Camera and looks.  Design: 5/5 Excellent design and looks. iPhones are very common these days and being owner of this unique phone brings sense of pride. People just love my phone when they see it.   CONS  Battery : 4/5 Battery backup is awesome but not that great. Lasts enough just like iPhones. Charges 60% in just an hour which is great enough for me because I never charge my phone to 100%. I don't understand why people are complaining about it.  Fingerprint: 1/5 Fingerprint doesn't work well after recent updates to Android 14. I hope Google find the fix to this issue soon.  Display : Not that great, I guess. Sometimes touch didn't work properly for me. I don't know if I got defective one.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Feels very premium in hand. Day to day tasks are very smooth, Take very good photos. No editing like color enhance or anything is done on the attached photos. Tried playing BGMI, performance was smooth in game almost constant 60 fps but heats up while gaming so you can't play high end games for long.  I got the update the same day I got my phone so I updated it to Android 14, and all the reviews are based on that experience  Heated when I was setting the phone up, which included transferring of app and data from my old phone to this one and during the first 2 updates.  After that i didn't face any issues with the heating in normal usage, still heats on graphic intensive tasks though, but again almost every phone heats up my old realme heats up too and even iqoo 9 Se of my brother but pixel heats up relatively quickly than iQoo 9Se, hell even iPhone 15 pro Max heats up.  Battery backup was below average on the first two days then it started to improve, Google does some ai magic in the background.  Now it can easily handle a day for medium usage. Today itself the screen on time is around 6 hour 10 minutes and it still had 21 % battery left. It has been around 24 hours since I last charged it. I guess it will give around 1.5 hours more SOT.  On the first day it was around 4.5 hours today it will be 7.5-8 hours of SOT. But today I didn't do any graphic intensive task apart from recording a 1080p 60 fps video for around 30 minutes .  And my screen refresh rate is set to smooth 90hz\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Purchased this phone trusted the name of google. In the hope, maybe they will be competitive and will make phones like apple. But unfortunately the phone finger touch sensor useless. When checked with other users about this issue, they reported same thing. Other is heating problem, I really regret putting in few more bucks and buying a more stable and reliable product than this. I think google need to first resolve the basic issues before improving advance issues.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Best choice in the Android segment. The camera is very good, and the battery lasts for 24 hr for me in moderate use. Phone heats up more than normal, but it will be improved later after adjustment. No preinstall boatwares.  Review after using a couple of days. I will update later if there are any drastic changes.  Update: after a few days heating problem solved. May be due to AI as claimed by Google\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it is a good product, I am giving this review after 1 week of use and also after the update of Android 14  Camera is awesome but night camera isn't that good noise is easily visible, performance is better than Good but not for high level gamers casual gamers will be happy, yeah it gets a little bit hot but not irritating hot and that can be managed !! Comfortable to hold Easy to use Average charging speed It look really different and everyone will gonna to notice it!! If you are not a high gamer and wants a good looking and different from others you can go for it\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Bought the Coral variant during BBD. The phone was warming up during setup but got 2 security updates and Android 14 during setup itself and the phone has been a pleasure to use. I've not faced any network issues or heating issues. The camera is awesome. Battery backup is okay, I'm getting 1 full day on each charge. Charging speed is painfully slow though.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: FYI- The cover is not included with the phone. I bought that separately.  The smoothness of the phone, the picture quality and the photo optimization of Google pixel 7a is amazing. We have magic eraser, portrait blur, and long exposure for the photographers of the house. You will definitely love these features if you like taking pictures. Also we get the latest updates first as its Google.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first pixel device and I would say that the build quality is very good. No loose frame or cracking sound. Very compact phone with 6.1 inch screen. Very easy to use one handed. Camera quality is top notch. You just point and shoot. It would be a very good photo. Charging is kept at 18 watt but that's fine. Battery backup is fine for me. It is giving 5 hours of screen time with normal usage. For this price it is very good upgrade from 6A. If looking for your first pixel device this is a go to phone you can buy it blindly.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing this phone after one month of usage.  Camera- 9/10 . It captures detailed photos but a dedicated zoom lens is missing so zoomed photos are not clear.  Performance - 10/10. This phone performs great in every day tasks. Multitasking and ram management is great. I don't do heavy gaming but you can play games like pubg and cod with no issues.  Battery -8/10. After tweaking some settings, I get about 6 hours of SOT every day. Battery charging is not too slow but not fast either. I get no heating issues till now.  Design - 10/10. I like it's compact design. It's very easy for one hand use. Phone don't feel too big in pocket. Build quality is also great. Plastic on the back mimic like glass and have good quality.  Display 9/10. Display colours are vibrant. Movies look good in this display. Although it struggles when you use in direct sunlight. Display is not bright enough.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I use this as a secondary device. Updated to android14 the day I got it. Not much of heating issues. With tempered glass the fingerprint works only half the time. It gives me 6 hours of SOT and I get 1.5-2 days from one full charge to another. If you're a light user It'll easily come for 1.5 days, for a medium user it'll last a day. If you're a heavy user and play games constantly, this phone ain't for you. And yes the charging will take almost 2 hours. Overall it's a beautiful phone with a great camera.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: pros  camera design performance software support display (90hz is good coming from 120hz it's good doesn't feel too much of difference)  corn slow charging (18watt max). battery backup is not great but acceptable. heats the top left aluminium frame. it will get warm on normal day to day tasks, it's bearable (every phone heats that much) but when you run benchmark or do software updates then it gets pretty hot like a lot. bezels are quite huge price (if you get around 30k then it's good but 40k is too much )  i have given it 5 stars because i got the device for around 27.5k (including exchange and bank offers), for that price the phone is totally worth it and value for money. if i would have bought the same device for around 40k i would have given it a 3/5 stars.\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: The phone is pretty in looks but is not at all worth the price tag. They'll have to bring it down to 28-30k like before.  Heating is still a BIG problem, even at 25C ambient temperature, the phone will start heating while doing the most basic stuff like scrolling through IG, video calling, YouTube/Netflix streaming or simply browsing the web. It really becomes uncomfortable to hold.  The camera is not as good as the Pixel 7, which is expected.  The front camera is very very weak in low light, too much noise reduction in video. Loss of details is evident.  Performance is fine, nothing extraordinary, there are lags and frame drops while multi tasking for swiping through heavy apps. It is irritating given the fact that same chip is used in 7 and 7pro. Save your money, spend it elsewhere.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Recently purchased this pixel. Overall a good product in this range. Pure Android. The display is good. Inbuilt security chip/feature but it doesn't matter if you are using it for daily usage The camera is as good as Google says Inbuilt AI feature and Google apps are best.  The only concern is battery and charging. With a 40-watt/20-watt fast charger, it is taking 6 hours to charge fully. I don't know why Google does this but it is not recommended to use this phone as a primary phone if you travel and mostly away from home\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after a month! The phone is too good, it's so smooth at 90hz and the in hand feel is too premium and also the main thing is it's compact! Camera- it is literally the best at this price range, I had iPhone 13 previously and this pixel takes much better and original colour photos than that! Processor - the processor is good for normal use I tried bgmi and took the hot drop then it lagged like crazy but after 1 min it got stable and I was getting 55-60 fps constant at smooth extreme, though it's not a gaming device, it can run games with decent performance. Battery - The battery is good, it takes approx 1.5 hrs to charge on original Samsung charger, and it drains a little fast while using camera and games but In scrolling, calls, normal tasks it is very great! Display- The display is good and very responsive and pixel animations are so gorgeous but the full brightness feels low in outside conditions! So overall I'd give 4.5/5 to this device, also this phone heated a lot while setting up for the first time and when I upgraded it to Android 14 but after that it has never heated a bit except it gets warm while using camera or games for long time!\n",

I am an average user but still the battery drains very quickly, even after charging it all night in steady mode, it drains in half day only. Performance is also ok. The phone hangs alot and gets stuck multiple times\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: As you will see in many reviews: 1) The camera is awesome without any doubt. 2) Battery is OK last whole day with moderate use, but charging is slow. 3) Device heats little on calls, which is not good. But even the iPhone heats on video calls. 4) Screen/Display is awesome, tried increasing little system font. Letter and images are crisp. 5) Face recognition works only in light, which is utterly poor. So I'm just using touch ID which is just fine and secure.  It's been just one month, I'll update later. I got it in replacement with my 2.5 years old iPhone 11 128 GB. For me it's worth it as the camera and screen are far better than the iPhone 11.  A clean Android experience of course.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Camera: best part of the device and in my comparison it's even better then the well known flagships. Battery: if you are heavy user probably you will need to change during the day, else will just make it till the end of the day. Also wait for the device to optimise itself in 2-3 days post first time setup. Charging: this is a bin negative and yes the charging speed is snail pace low...it take literally 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Overheating: does get warm up during hefty usage otherwise it's fine. Also just to draw a comparison, we are mi and realme people compared to it it's not even warm 🤣 Jokes apart yes it gets warm but upon heavy usage and if you have restricted background apps then that too will get resolved. Performance: absolute delight all apps and tasks run butter smooth, not a gamer though but played few light games ran fine. UI experience: flawless...90hz display is not enabled by default but once you enable it...it becomes whole different experience. Display: display is good quality OLED, no complaints but yes little less Max brightness so direct under the sun visibility is good not great.  Finally: would recommend it as it's a great phone and ticks most of the qualities one looks for in a device. Only problem I see is the battery, if your usage is high then this is not the device for you. As battery won't last long and you will stay plugged for a very long time to add some.\n",

The performance is smooth for a normal day to life user .The Camera is also excellent as expected. The battery is bigger but not tested yet since I got it today only, 68 Watt charger takes just some moments to load it completely. Go for it 😉   PS: Check tempered glass availability in your locality prior to buying , or Conceder add it while buying the beauty.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Battery drains fastly comparatively. Overall phone is good, camera/design/ processing everything is excellent. But there is only one issue that battery drains fastly even when the phone is not in use.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: My Honest Review (after using it for more than a week) 1) Display: Before buying this phone I had realme x7 Max which had amoled fhd+ display with 409 PPI and this phone has 393 PPI so I can spot the difference in the sharpness and quality which I missed out during my reasearch. The rest aspects of display are good. 2) Camera: Again, my old phone had 64mp rear so I could see better details after zooming in the clicked picture or live 4k video compared to this phone. But, this phone has good after processing functionality so it might be a bit satisfactory. 3) Software: By far it's good. Did not feel jittery anywhere apart from camera app opening and closing times but it's rare. 4) Battery: I never charge my phone to 100%. I always charge it within the 35-85% range which will help to prolong the life and I'm not a heavy user so I can easily get 5.30 hours of sot before the next charge which roughly takes about 15-20 minutes. And, also I didn't enable the Charge boost to avoid overheating the battery while charging. So, this department is great. 5) others: Didn't face any calling issues, even wifi calling experience is good. Difficulty in finding the right case for the phone to ensure the safety so need to use it carefully. Idle drain 3% at night at 120hz RR, 4%-5% at night at 144hz RR.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola 50 Fusion, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! The camera is excellent, capturing stunning photos with great detail and vibrant colors. The phone is super lightweight, making it easy to carry around without feeling bulky.  One of the standout features for me is the quick charging capability. It saves me so much time and keeps me going throughout the day without constantly worrying about battery life. Another big plus is the absence of bloatware, which means a cleaner and smoother user experience.  The 5G connectivity is top-notch, providing fast and reliable internet speeds. Overall, it's a fantastic phone with great features. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's always room for a bit of improvement. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The main selling point of the phone is the display, which was awesome. The camera was also good, but the software needs to be improved because it boosts color. The phone was lightweight, the design was good, the leather finish gave it a premium feel, they provided a 67w charger, the software was also good, and the UI was neat. However, while holding the phone, it had a slippery feel even with the back cover because it was curved glass. The phone had a stereo speaker, but sound was not clear, punchy\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Reviewing after 2days of using Moto Edge 50pro (125W, 12gb RAM variant) -  Display - 10/10 Battery - 8/10 Camera - 8/10 Charging - 9/10  Pros - Light weight, premiumness, flagship features  Cons- Lots of heating issues while charging, booting, long time scrolling, Battery drains little quick as expected.  Charging speed(125W): 0-50% in 11min 0-80% in 20mins 0-100% in 29mins.  This phone is very good as per the specs provided. You can go for it. I hope heating issues will be resolved in future updates.  Everything depends on usage and P2P, the above views are my observations and may differ.\n",

I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.  3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.  4. Battery: Battery back is good for one full day by keeping the internet all the time on. I especially want to talk about a 125W charger which really charges mobile in less time.  I am really happy with this mobile and recommend buying it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Superb Design Trendy Look Decent Display Fast Charger All these are good...  But Heating Issue makes it hard to Hold... Immediate bug fix needed...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.  The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice as expected! Highly recommended  The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely Premium/flagship phone. i have used iphones from last 4 years and recently used S24 and nothing phone 2 for months as primary device. Edge 50 pro feel beautiful choice it is not as premium as iphone or s24 but you won't regret if you bought this.  Extremely beautiful display, i think it is as beautiful as s24 and iphones display. 10/10 for this extremely good display i can't believe i bought this for 30k. i feel same beauty as iPhones. believe me, display will not disappoint you even if you use iPhones....  Performance : probably decent not as good as iPhones or any premium phones. it's just justify the price but don't expect much.  Design? : I am not a fan of this awkward 4 camera set design but yeah built quality is fairly good so thumbs up.  Battery! I haven't got extremely good battery life , expect 6 hours sot probably.  Camera 📸 No way guys, This is something i can say better than nothing phone 2 or oneplus 12r ... i am stunned however it captures pics and later process it but outcome always suprises me... extremely good 😊 but videos are just fair don't expect much as well.  Heating Issues? i haven't faced any heating issue at all I don't know how people are complaint about heating and display issues... don't worry much about these things    Conclusion : If your budget is tight or want a premium phone in lesser price just get this one. Keep in mind you can't expect extremely good performance like flagship. decent performance, premium display and built. that's all you get. You won't feel post purchase regret 😚  If you are confused and you don't do heavy task all the time just buy this i can guarantee you won't regret. even people like me who uses flagships i am suprised how good this phone is.. i am using this as primary device.   Wishing you best buy. ✨\n",

For office use, I am getting a minimum 28 hours of battery backup. 125W charger takes 30min to change from 10-100%. The camera quality is really superb. The display is also good. The only problem which is observed is - screen guard and mobile cover provided with mobile are very poor quality and not for use. The camera takes some 6-8 seconds to process the picture. It may be solved in the next update. Worth for money. Thanks to Flipkart for quick and smooth service.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Battery: I wake up in the morning charge my phone and come to the office, watch a movie on the train, use the office Wi-Fi all day, the phone is used enough, on the way home to watch a movie, come back home and use the Wi-Fi, my mobile data usage is very low. About 2-3 hours all day, but when I wake up the next day, the phone has above 40 percent charge, tell me if it's a good battery or a bad battery. Camera: I have been using S21FE5G mobile for 2 years so my Samsung was best except for portrait mode, but one more thing my Samsung camera app was slow, which this phone doesn't have, it is very fast. Performance: I was scared to buy after seeing negative reviews in many places that UFS 2.1 is very slow but after using it for 10 days I couldn't feel the slowness from any angle. If there is any glitch, it is from the UI, it will be fixed when the software update comes. Charger/Temperature: I saw reviews in many places that there is overheat issue but when I set up the phone it got hot but I don't get overheat all day even from non AC and when I charge it with 125-watt charger the phone gets hot that's normal there shouldn't be so much controversy about it, if I Let me give you a small example. My Samsung phone charger was 25 watts. When my phone was charged below 15% to 100%, both the charger and the phone would be very hot, so I think it's normal. Sound: There are stereo speakers, the sound is strong but the quality could be better. Display: When I bought the phone I didn't even know if it had any display protection but Motorola chat support confirmed to me that it has Gorilla Glass 5 protection which I have saved a screenshot of.\n",

I hope the moto will fix these issues with updates\n",

Later when it becomes normal usage almost 1 day back up. Charging is super fast within 25-30 mins with a 125w ch arger. The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience. Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times. Overall it's good purchase\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Point-wise review for the Motorola Edge 50 Pro:  1. Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch P-OLED display offers vibrant colors and crisp details. 2. Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good performance\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Superb Design Trendy Look Decent Display Fast Charger All these are good...  But Heating Issue makes it hard to Hold... Immediate bug fix needed...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely Premium/flagship phone. i have used iphones from last 4 years and recently used S24 and nothing phone 2 for months as primary device. Edge 50 pro feel beautiful choice it is not as premium as iphone or s24 but you won't regret if you bought this.  Extremely beautiful display, i think it is as beautiful as s24 and iphones display. 10/10 for this extremely good display i can't believe i bought this for 30k. i feel same beauty as iPhones. believe me, display will not disappoint you even if you use iPhones....  Performance : probably decent not as good as iPhones or any premium phones. it's just justify the price but don't expect much.  Design? : I am not a fan of this awkward 4 camera set design but yeah built quality is fairly good so thumbs up.  Battery! I haven't got extremely good battery life , expect 6 hours sot probably.  Camera 📸 No way guys, This is something i can say better than nothing phone 2 or oneplus 12r ... i am stunned however it captures pics and later process it but outcome always suprises me... extremely good 😊 but videos are just fair don't expect much as well.  Heating Issues? i haven't faced any heating issue at all I don't know how people are complaint about heating and display issues... don't worry much about these things    Conclusion : If your budget is tight or want a premium phone in lesser price just get this one. Keep in mind you can't expect extremely good performance like flagship. decent performance, premium display and built. that's all you get. You won't feel post purchase regret 😚  If you are confused and you don't do heavy task all the time just buy this i can guarantee you won't regret. even people like me who uses flagships i am suprised how good this phone is.. i am using this as primary device.   Wishing you best buy. ✨\n",

For office use, I am getting a minimum 28 hours of battery backup. 125W charger takes 30min to change from 10-100%. The camera quality is really superb. The display is also good. The only problem which is observed is - screen guard and mobile cover provided with mobile are very poor quality and not for use. The camera takes some 6-8 seconds to process the picture. It may be solved in the next update. Worth for money. Thanks to Flipkart for quick and smooth service.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Battery: I wake up in the morning charge my phone and come to the office, watch a movie on the train, use the office Wi-Fi all day, the phone is used enough, on the way home to watch a movie, come back home and use the Wi-Fi, my mobile data usage is very low. About 2-3 hours all day, but when I wake up the next day, the phone has above 40 percent charge, tell me if it's a good battery or a bad battery. Camera: I have been using S21FE5G mobile for 2 years so my Samsung was best except for portrait mode, but one more thing my Samsung camera app was slow, which this phone doesn't have, it is very fast. Performance: I was scared to buy after seeing negative reviews in many places that UFS 2.1 is very slow but after using it for 10 days I couldn't feel the slowness from any angle. If there is any glitch, it is from the UI, it will be fixed when the software update comes. Charger/Temperature: I saw reviews in many places that there is overheat issue but when I set up the phone it got hot but I don't get overheat all day even from non AC and when I charge it with 125-watt charger the phone gets hot that's normal there shouldn't be so much controversy about it, if I Let me give you a small example. My Samsung phone charger was 25 watts. When my phone was charged below 15% to 100%, both the charger and the phone would be very hot, so I think it's normal. Sound: There are stereo speakers, the sound is strong but the quality could be better. Display: When I bought the phone I didn't even know if it had any display protection but Motorola chat support confirmed to me that it has Gorilla Glass 5 protection which I have saved a screenshot of.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: My Review...  1 - I compared the camera of Motorola Edge 50 Pro with the recently launched mobiles like Vivo T3 Pro and Mi Redmi Note 13 Pro. The camera of Motorola Edge 50 Pro is much better than both the mobiles, it is fantastic and amazing, I am very satisfied.  2 ) The battery backup is very good. The mobile gets fully charged in 20 to 25 minutes and gives a backup of 30 to 32 hours. There is no heating issue in the mobile.  3 ) The look of the mobile is premium. I am very impressed with the Curve display. It is very smooth to use. The processor is very good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB): A Sleek Everyday Powerhouse (Review)  You're spot on about the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) being a compelling choice. The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This Phone is the best in the price range, It is as I expected but I have seen a disadvantage till now is that you have to avoid using a uv protector glass (specially glue while installing uv protector) with this phone.

I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

Normal heating is there not much. You can consider this phone without much thinking. Look is awesome.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic product in this price range . Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage . Based on my experience CAMERA-4.5/5 It boost the colors a bit but it does not ruin your pictures. BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone looks good and operates smoothly. The OS is clean Android, the camera is good, and the battery life is strong. However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.

You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost. If that sounds like you, it's definitely worth considering.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Yes battery drain fast, but I was looking for compact device and Samsung was out of my range, so purchased this. Please make smaller devices, between 5.5 to 6 inch devices.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This feels really very premium Quality is good at this price point along with 5 years update. The camera is quite good as it offers 3X optical zoom Touch and finish feels premium Charging speed is Really fast with a 68 watt charger Moto gestures are a big Plus It's like an iphone of the Android offering a 5 year update.  Must buy if You are looking for an all rounder phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: MUST KNOW BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE--- 1. DON'T BUY if you are a GAMER, REEL ADDICT OR DOOM SCROLLER. 2. MUST BUY if you want DURABLE LONG LASTING SIMPLE COMPACT PHONE WHICH GETS THE JOB DONE.  Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola Edge 50 Neo ❤️, and it has exceeded my expectations! The sleek design and vibrant display make for a stunning visual experience, while the performance is incredibly smooth, handling all apps and games effortlessly. The camera quality is fantastic, capturing sharp and vivid photos even in low light. Battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of heavy use. I also love the clean Android experience without any bloatware. Overall, this phone offers amazing value for its price, and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This review after using 7 days.  In many reviews, I saw many people saying the camera is not good. But after usage, I can say the camera is not so bad, it's very good, both front and back. Obviously you can't expect a DSLR like photography. It's a phone not a DSLR .  Battery backup with fast charging facility is very good. And RAM optimisation is amazing. It goes full day in moderate usage. If gaming then you should charge twice daily which is quite obvious. And this phone is not for hardcore gaming, if you want hardcore gaming, then purchase a gaming phone.  The display quality is just amazing and superb.  The size of the phone is quite handy and has a nice grip feeling to hold the leather back.  There is no heating issue found.  Conclusion : This is the must buy phone in 2024. Go for it without any hesitation. 😊❤️\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Good phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Ditched my decision of buying edge 50 fusion at the last minute and went with this. It's a wonderful phone. Performance is good for some one who does routine tasks and not into extreme gaming( though I had no issue with playing PUBg)  Pros: ----- 1. Design and look and color 2. Great Display 3. Small and light form factor 4. Camera 5. OS and Moto AI especially AI generated wallpaper 6. Performance 7. No heating  Cons: ------ 1. Small battery 2. No audio jack  Also was confused between Poinciana and Latte color and trust me Latte is too good in real. Glad I didn't make the wrong choice\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone must buy Totally 4.9/5. My rating Camera 🔥\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's my first experience with motorola and I can literally say that you guys won't regret with this phone and it's performance.....

I wrote this review 1 month later from the date of purchase .\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto edge 50 neo is an awesome phone for day to day usage. Despite being smaller battery size, it lasts whole day easily with moderate usage. I used to handle a lot of calls and use watsapp during my office timings with surfing on google, surprisigly it lasts whole day with 40% battery remaining at the evening. Its form factor and design is awesome. Camera is decent. I am using S22 plus as my primary device. But moto's display is awesome, better than S22. Also battery lasts way more than S22 plus. Thanks to its good optimization and LTPO display. Touch and feel is also very nice. No overheating issue. Charging is superfast. Go ahead for it. Its an awesome device for the price.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are looking for a compact phone with good cameras and decent performance and stock android without any ads this phone is for you.  Pros 1.display is really impressive with 1.5k 120 hz ltpo and bezels are so thin 2. Design is very eye pleadings with vegan leather and it is so comfortable to hold 3.battery backup is actually good( I was expecting worse) i got sot 6-7hrs with moderate usage (refresh rate at auto). 4.camera is really good in this price range with 3x telephoto I am addicted using it. Videos comes out really good with no jitters and shaking. 5.ui experience is really good too with no ads and bloatwares and also so many moto features. In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",

People complaining about the battery due to its small size but in my device I'm getting more than one day battery backup with moderate use. Dont know how but it's 4310mah battery performance is better than my samsung s20fe with 4500 mah and other mobiles with 5000mah batteries. No overheating issue, no network issue. Its good deal.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

The display is absolutely beautiful with minimal bezels and top colours. And the speakers are also very good but little down on bass. However, performance in not as impressive for long sessions of gaming as it tends to heat up after some but overall there are no stutters or jitters. It offers excellent battery life for light to medium usage and performs well for everyday tasks. For the 1 week I didn't get good battery life then gradually it got better now I am getting very good SOT of 7-9 hrs.

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone tends to heat up in daily usage, a typical characteristic of a mediatek processor phone.  A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent. Performance while taking photos could have been improved from software perspective.  Migrated from an old phone to this one. All apps got installed, some got missed. Now installing those and logging in into all the apps.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Opinion after using for 16 days:  Great phone at this price, only issue is overheating and slight low battery.  Pros - Everything else is great, except: Cons- 1. Overheating - Phone heats up during charging. It heats up even more than this, when sharing mobile hotspot alone(greater than 10 minutes). Wouldn't recommend mixing these two together. This may be a concern especially during summers.  2. Battery - Battery is a bit less. 5000mAh would've been better. On light usage (2-3 hrs screen time per day), it stretches up to 1.5-2 days. On heavy usage, you might need to charge it twice during a day (especially if you mostly use the camera).  68W charging may compensate for it, but you'd have to turn down the screen refresh rate to 60 Hz, if you're travelling for the entire day and need the juice in your phone, especially during trips/vacations (where camera usage is higher), or just in case, if any emergency occurs.  Coming to the last point, the cover included in the box (semi-hard material, non-TPU/non-Silicone) complements the color of the phone, but it doesn't cover the sides (only covers the corners).\n",

Battery capacity could be increased because most of the people don't use wireless charging in this price range. Overall if you're looking for a compact and balanced smartphone ( not for gaming ) then you can definitely go for this considering the battery performance. Anything to ask you can.\n",

Works good while playing bgmi giving 54-58 fps without lag but get slightly hot which is considerable. Display: 5 out of 5 . Very good display with 3000 nits brightness feels heaven. Overall it's best for normal user and can be good for gamer who just want moderate gaming.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB): A Sleek Everyday Powerhouse (Review)  You're spot on about the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) being a compelling choice. The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

Normal heating is there not much. You can consider this phone without much thinking. Look is awesome.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic product in this price range . Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage . Based on my experience CAMERA-4.5/5 It boost the colors a bit but it does not ruin your pictures. BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone looks good and operates smoothly. The OS is clean Android, the camera is good, and the battery life is strong. However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

The battery will easily last you for a day and even if it doesn't you can use the fast charger to charge your phone quickly. The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.

      "Rating: 5, Review: The photo is a sample , turned on all post processing. The phone seems like a complete package. Very good display, a bit taller. You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

      "Product Price: ₹29,999\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Reviewing after 2days of using Moto Edge 50pro (125W, 12gb RAM variant) -  Display - 10/10 Battery - 8/10 Camera - 8/10 Charging - 9/10  Pros - Light weight, premiumness, flagship features  Cons- Lots of heating issues while charging, booting, long time scrolling, Battery drains little quick as expected.  Charging speed(125W): 0-50% in 11min 0-80% in 20mins 0-100% in 29mins.  This phone is very good as per the specs provided. You can go for it. I hope heating issues will be resolved in future updates.  Everything depends on usage and P2P, the above views are my observations and may differ.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this mobile for the last 6 days and overall I am very Happy with this mobile.  1. Design: The design is very eye-catching and, feels very good and confident to hold in hand.  2. Camera: Camera set up is really awesome and best in this segment. I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.  3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.  4. Battery: Battery back is good for one full day by keeping the internet all the time on. I especially want to talk about a 125W charger which really charges mobile in less time.  I am really happy with this mobile and recommend buying it.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Just received my moto edge 50 pro yesterday. Look wise mobile is very good. All accessories were in the box, although the back cover is kind of useless. The 125W charger is charging mobile fast as advertised by moto. As of now the performance looks great. Camera is great specially front camera. Colors are quite realistic. I've given 4 star as of now, will update my review after few weeks of use.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very nice camera\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Point-wise review for the Motorola Edge 50 Pro:  1. Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch P-OLED display offers vibrant colors and crisp details. 2. Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Excellent product Display is awesome Batery is good Camara is excellent for this price\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is Good. But , battery 🔋 optimisation is not good. Because I am not a heavy user, I still charge my mobile minimum 3 times per day. Maybe it' will be solved in the next update.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good performance\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Superb Design Trendy Look Decent Display Fast Charger All these are good...  But Heating Issue makes it hard to Hold... Immediate bug fix needed...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely Premium/flagship phone. i have used iphones from last 4 years and recently used S24 and nothing phone 2 for months as primary device. Edge 50 pro feel beautiful choice it is not as premium as iphone or s24 but you won't regret if you bought this.  Extremely beautiful display, i think it is as beautiful as s24 and iphones display. 10/10 for this extremely good display i can't believe i bought this for 30k. i feel same beauty as iPhones. believe me, display will not disappoint you even if you use iPhones....  Performance : probably decent not as good as iPhones or any premium phones. it's just justify the price but don't expect much.  Design? : I am not a fan of this awkward 4 camera set design but yeah built quality is fairly good so thumbs up.  Battery! I haven't got extremely good battery life , expect 6 hours sot probably.  Camera 📸 No way guys, This is something i can say better than nothing phone 2 or oneplus 12r ... i am stunned however it captures pics and later process it but outcome always suprises me... extremely good 😊 but videos are just fair don't expect much as well.  Heating Issues? i haven't faced any heating issue at all I don't know how people are complaint about heating and display issues... don't worry much about these things    Conclusion : If your budget is tight or want a premium phone in lesser price just get this one. Keep in mind you can't expect extremely good performance like flagship. decent performance, premium display and built. that's all you get. You won't feel post purchase regret 😚  If you are confused and you don't do heavy task all the time just buy this i can guarantee you won't regret. even people like me who uses flagships i am suprised how good this phone is.. i am using this as primary device.

For office use, I am getting a minimum 28 hours of battery backup. 125W charger takes 30min to change from 10-100%. The camera quality is really superb. The display is also good. The only problem which is observed is - screen guard and mobile cover provided with mobile are very poor quality and not for use. The camera takes some 6-8 seconds to process the picture. It may be solved in the next update. Worth for money. Thanks to Flipkart for quick and smooth service.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Battery: I wake up in the morning charge my phone and come to the office, watch a movie on the train, use the office Wi-Fi all day, the phone is used enough, on the way home to watch a movie, come back home and use the Wi-Fi, my mobile data usage is very low. About 2-3 hours all day, but when I wake up the next day, the phone has above 40 percent charge, tell me if it's a good battery or a bad battery. Camera: I have been using S21FE5G mobile for 2 years so my Samsung was best except for portrait mode, but one more thing my Samsung camera app was slow, which this phone doesn't have, it is very fast. Performance: I was scared to buy after seeing negative reviews in many places that UFS 2.1 is very slow but after using it for 10 days I couldn't feel the slowness from any angle. If there is any glitch, it is from the UI, it will be fixed when the software update comes. Charger/Temperature: I saw reviews in many places that there is overheat issue but when I set up the phone it got hot but I don't get overheat all day even from non AC and when I charge it with 125-watt charger the phone gets hot that's normal there shouldn't be so much controversy about it, if I Let me give you a small example. My Samsung phone charger was 25 watts. When my phone was charged below 15% to 100%, both the charger and the phone would be very hot, so I think it's normal. Sound: There are stereo speakers, the sound is strong but the quality could be better. Display: When I bought the phone I didn't even know if it had any display protection but Motorola chat support confirmed to me that it has Gorilla Glass 5 protection which I have saved a screenshot of.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: My Review...  1 - I compared the camera of Motorola Edge 50 Pro with the recently launched mobiles like Vivo T3 Pro and Mi Redmi Note 13 Pro. The camera of Motorola Edge 50 Pro is much better than both the mobiles, it is fantastic and amazing, I am very satisfied.  2 ) The battery backup is very good. The mobile gets fully charged in 20 to 25 minutes and gives a backup of 30 to 32 hours. There is no heating issue in the mobile.  3 ) The look of the mobile is premium. I am very impressed with the Curve display. It is very smooth to use. The processor is very good.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is good but it's not that great compared to what motorola claims... The camera is ok.. sometimes it gives darker pics compared to normal. Videos are good sometimes it adds color which is not natural. Also the battery is not good you have to carry a charger with you. Thought charging is fast. Also while charging the phone heats a lot even if you're not using it while charging. Overall it is a good phone but the price range is high compared to other phones compared to the performance. I hope the moto will fix these issues with updates\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's a nice product. The camera is good. Bit sometimes lag. Performance is good. Battery backup is not so good initially as high usage. Later when it becomes normal usage almost 1 day back up. Charging is super fast within 25-30 mins with a 125w ch arger. The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience. Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times. Overall it's good purchase\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Battery drains fastly comparatively. Overall phone is good, camera/design/ processing everything is excellent. But there is only one issue that battery drains fastly even when the phone is not in use.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: My Honest Review (after using it for more than a week) 1) Display: Before buying this phone I had realme x7 Max which had amoled fhd+ display with 409 PPI and this phone has 393 PPI so I can spot the difference in the sharpness and quality which I missed out during my reasearch. The rest aspects of display are good. 2) Camera: Again, my old phone had 64mp rear so I could see better details after zooming in the clicked picture or live 4k video compared to this phone. But, this phone has good after processing functionality so it might be a bit satisfactory. 3) Software: By far it's good. Did not feel jittery anywhere apart from camera app opening and closing times but it's rare. 4) Battery: I never charge my phone to 100%. I always charge it within the 35-85% range which will help to prolong the life and I'm not a heavy user so I can easily get 5.30 hours of sot before the next charge which roughly takes about 15-20 minutes. And, also I didn't enable the Charge boost to avoid overheating the battery while charging. So, this department is great. 5) others: Didn't face any calling issues, even wifi calling experience is good. Difficulty in finding the right case for the phone to ensure the safety so need to use it carefully. Idle drain 3% at night at 120hz RR, 4%-5% at night at 144hz RR.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola 50 Fusion, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! The camera is excellent, capturing stunning photos with great detail and vibrant colors. The phone is super lightweight, making it easy to carry around without feeling bulky.  One of the standout features for me is the quick charging capability. It saves me so much time and keeps me going throughout the day without constantly worrying about battery life. Another big plus is the absence of bloatware, which means a cleaner and smoother user experience.  The 5G connectivity is top-notch, providing fast and reliable internet speeds. Overall, it's a fantastic phone with great features. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's always room for a bit of improvement. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Battery drains fastly comparatively. Overall phone is good, camera/design/ processing everything is excellent. But there is only one issue that battery drains fastly even when the phone is not in use.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: My Honest Review (after using it for more than a week) 1) Display: Before buying this phone I had realme x7 Max which had amoled fhd+ display with 409 PPI and this phone has 393 PPI so I can spot the difference in the sharpness and quality which I missed out during my reasearch. The rest aspects of display are good. 2) Camera: Again, my old phone had 64mp rear so I could see better details after zooming in the clicked picture or live 4k video compared to this phone. But, this phone has good after processing functionality so it might be a bit satisfactory. 3) Software: By far it's good. Did not feel jittery anywhere apart from camera app opening and closing times but it's rare. 4) Battery: I never charge my phone to 100%. I always charge it within the 35-85% range which will help to prolong the life and I'm not a heavy user so I can easily get 5.30 hours of sot before the next charge which roughly takes about 15-20 minutes. And, also I didn't enable the Charge boost to avoid overheating the battery while charging. So, this department is great. 5) others: Didn't face any calling issues, even wifi calling experience is good. Difficulty in finding the right case for the phone to ensure the safety so need to use it carefully. Idle drain 3% at night at 120hz RR, 4%-5% at night at 144hz RR.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola 50 Fusion, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! The camera is excellent, capturing stunning photos with great detail and vibrant colors. The phone is super lightweight, making it easy to carry around without feeling bulky.  One of the standout features for me is the quick charging capability. It saves me so much time and keeps me going throughout the day without constantly worrying about battery life. Another big plus is the absence of bloatware, which means a cleaner and smoother user experience.  The 5G connectivity is top-notch, providing fast and reliable internet speeds. Overall, it's a fantastic phone with great features. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's always room for a bit of improvement. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The main selling point of the phone is the display, which was awesome. The camera was also good, but the software needs to be improved because it boosts color. The phone was lightweight, the design was good, the leather finish gave it a premium feel, they provided a 67w charger, the software was also good, and the UI was neat. However, while holding the phone, it had a slippery feel even with the back cover because it was curved glass. The phone had a stereo speaker, but sound was not clear, punchy\n",

      "Product Name: Motorola Edge 50 Neo (PANTONE Latte, 256 GB)  (8 GB RAM)\n",
      "Product Price: ₹23,999\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost. If that sounds like you, it's definitely worth considering.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Yes battery drain fast, but I was looking for compact device and Samsung was out of my range, so purchased this. Please make smaller devices, between 5.5 to 6 inch devices.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This feels really very premium Quality is good at this price point along with 5 years update. The camera is quite good as it offers 3X optical zoom Touch and finish feels premium Charging speed is Really fast with a 68 watt charger Moto gestures are a big Plus It's like an iphone of the Android offering a 5 year update.  Must buy if You are looking for an all rounder phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: MUST KNOW BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE--- 1. DON'T BUY if you are a GAMER, REEL ADDICT OR DOOM SCROLLER. 2. MUST BUY if you want DURABLE LONG LASTING SIMPLE COMPACT PHONE WHICH GETS THE JOB DONE.  Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Ditched my decision of buying edge 50 fusion at the last minute and went with this. It's a wonderful phone. Performance is good for some one who does routine tasks and not into extreme gaming( though I had no issue with playing PUBg)  Pros: ----- 1. Design and look and color 2. Great Display 3. Small and light form factor 4. Camera 5. OS and Moto AI especially AI generated wallpaper 6. Performance 7. No heating  Cons: ------ 1. Small battery 2. No audio jack  Also was confused between Poinciana and Latte color and trust me Latte is too good in real. Glad I didn't make the wrong choice\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto edge 50 neo is an awesome phone for day to day usage. Despite being smaller battery size, it lasts whole day easily with moderate usage. I used to handle a lot of calls and use watsapp during my office timings with surfing on google, surprisigly it lasts whole day with 40% battery remaining at the evening. Its form factor and design is awesome. Camera is decent. I am using S22 plus as my primary device. But moto's display is awesome, better than S22. Also battery lasts way more than S22 plus. Thanks to its good optimization and LTPO display. Touch and feel is also very nice. No overheating issue. Charging is superfast. Go ahead for it. Its an awesome device for the price.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are looking for a compact phone with good cameras and decent performance and stock android without any ads this phone is for you.  Pros 1.display is really impressive with 1.5k 120 hz ltpo and bezels are so thin 2. Design is very eye pleadings with vegan leather and it is so comfortable to hold 3.battery backup is actually good( I was expecting worse) i got sot 6-7hrs with moderate usage (refresh rate at auto). 4.camera is really good in this price range with 3x telephoto I am addicted using it. Videos comes out really good with no jitters and shaking. 5.ui experience is really good too with no ads and bloatwares and also so many moto features. In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Review after 1 week usage Its compact and lightweight weight. Camera is decent but the camera app is lagy. People complaining about the battery due to its small size but in my device I'm getting more than one day battery backup with moderate use. Dont know how but it's 4310mah battery performance is better than my samsung s20fe with 4500 mah and other mobiles with 5000mah batteries. No overheating issue, no network issue. Its good deal.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

The display is absolutely beautiful with minimal bezels and top colours. And the speakers are also very good but little down on bass. However, performance in not as impressive for long sessions of gaming as it tends to heat up after some but overall there are no stutters or jitters. It offers excellent battery life for light to medium usage and performs well for everyday tasks. For the 1 week I didn't get good battery life then gradually it got better now I am getting very good SOT of 7-9 hrs.  Overall, this phone is a good choice for Light to medium usage like media consumption , photography, casual gaming, multitasking.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone tends to heat up in daily usage, a typical characteristic of a mediatek processor phone.  A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent. Performance while taking photos could have been improved from software perspective.  Migrated from an old phone to this one. All apps got installed, some got missed. Now installing those and logging in into all the apps.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Opinion after using for 16 days:  Great phone at this price, only issue is overheating and slight low battery.  Pros - Everything else is great, except: Cons- 1. Overheating - Phone heats up during charging. It heats up even more than this, when sharing mobile hotspot alone(greater than 10 minutes). Wouldn't recommend mixing these two together. This may be a concern especially during summers.  2. Battery - Battery is a bit less. 5000mAh would've been better. On light usage (2-3 hrs screen time per day), it stretches up to 1.5-2 days. On heavy usage, you might need to charge it twice during a day (especially if you mostly use the camera).  68W charging may compensate for it, but you'd have to turn down the screen refresh rate to 60 Hz, if you're travelling for the entire day and need the juice in your phone, especially during trips/vacations (where camera usage is higher), or just in case, if any emergency occurs.  Coming to the last point, the cover included in the box (semi-hard material, non-TPU/non-Silicone) complements the color of the phone, but it doesn't cover the sides (only covers the corners).\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Very balanced phone for daily use, minor bugs are there (like: when I'm taking screenshot by double tap on the back phone freezes) ,skin tone problem in camera although the camera is good for non human subject photos and when I switch on the flicker prevention the display goes green from one side in low brightness i compared with the same phone such problem is not in that piece. Battery capacity could be increased because most of the people don't use wireless charging in this price range. Overall if you're looking for a compact and balanced smartphone ( not for gaming ) then you can definitely go for this considering the battery performance. Anything to ask you can.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Flipkart BB sale !!! Amazing superfast next day delivery. Product quality is great. Light weight handset, superb screen refresh rate, good camera and excellent design. I appreciate moto for giving charging adaptor inside box. Other wise one has to buy it separately, it saves your expenses.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As a 2024 phone, it has everything all you need. It's a compact full-package phone with high-quality hands feel phone. There is just one problem which is its display color gamut. Its display color is a bit saturated. You need to set natural cool and it's good to go.\n",

With solid performance powered by capable hardware, it handles multitasking and gaming effectively. The battery life is commendable, easily lasting throughout the day. Overall, the Edge 50 Neo is a well-rounded smartphone that offers excellent value in the mid-range segment.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

I heard about edge 50, about the military grade certification and all but today is the day I actually believe it. Today my mom threw my phone in anger with her full strength ;(.

      "Rating: 4, Review: First time using a Motorola phone and my experience has been good so far. Switched from Asus Zenfone 5Z which is a great phone and after extensive research decided with Moto Edge 50. Pros: 1. Fantastic display 2. Moto UI 3. Stock android and no ads, bloatware 4. IP 65 and great build quality 5. Decent cameras  Cons: 1. Camera app does not load quickly. Not sure if it's a bug but it takes too long to launch camera. 2. The processor is average. I don't play games but even while processing photos it takes a couple of seconds to prepare the final image.  Overall a decent all round phone which handles your daily tasks pretty neat.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing a review after using it for more than a week.  1. In the current situation, we are having a bigger lag issue in camera opening to capture any photo. I am not sure if there will be a future sw update for the same.  2. I was not expecting that there will be some hang issue which is still there on the phone.  3. Battery performance is ok and i am able to run it for one day including my office emails, calls etc.  4. Screen resolutions and its display is very good and i like the performance of this one.  5. The sound quality i did not like as of now and not feeling for anything of Dolby sound, might be some software update will fix this.  6. Another issue found today which is related to heating when i have used the camera for a long time to capture photos for a long time in a party. And also due to the heat camera app was getting off itself.  7. The touch is very smooth in operating this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: After purchasing this phone, you will truly appreciate its value. At this price point, it offers everything you need. The display is exceptional, and with Gorilla Glass protection, you won't have to worry about durability. The phone's design is both premium and slim, providing a great in-hand feel making it seem like you're holding a high-end device. The camera is outstanding for this price range, with the ability to capture stunning portraits using the 3x telephoto lens (85mm), and the 3x zoom on the normal camera delivers superb photo quality. Performance is also strong, thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor.  Issues (These can be addressed in future software updates): - The camera app takes a significant amount of time to open. - Photo processing time is longer than expected after capturing an image. - Battery optimisation needs improvement, as there is a noticeable battery drain even when the screen is off.\n",

      "Product Name: Motorola Edge 50 Neo (PANTONE Nautical Blue, 256 GB)  (8 GB RAM)\n",
      "Product Price: ₹23,999\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost. If that sounds like you, it's definitely worth considering.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Yes battery drain fast, but I was looking for compact device and Samsung was out of my range, so purchased this. Please make smaller devices, between 5.5 to 6 inch devices.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This feels really very premium Quality is good at this price point along with 5 years update. The camera is quite good as it offers 3X optical zoom Touch and finish feels premium Charging speed is Really fast with a 68 watt charger Moto gestures are a big Plus It's like an iphone of the Android offering a 5 year update.  Must buy if You are looking for an all rounder phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: MUST KNOW BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE--- 1. DON'T BUY if you are a GAMER, REEL ADDICT OR DOOM SCROLLER. 2. MUST BUY if you want DURABLE LONG LASTING SIMPLE COMPACT PHONE WHICH GETS THE JOB DONE.  Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",

The camera quality is fantastic, capturing sharp and vivid photos even in low light. Battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of heavy use. I also love the clean Android experience without any bloatware. Overall, this phone offers amazing value for its price, and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This review after using 7 days.  In many reviews, I saw many people saying the camera is not good. But after usage, I can say the camera is not so bad, it's very good, both front and back. Obviously you can't expect a DSLR like photography. It's a phone not a DSLR .  Battery backup with fast charging facility is very good. And RAM optimisation is amazing. It goes full day in moderate usage. If gaming then you should charge twice daily which is quite obvious. And this phone is not for hardcore gaming, if you want hardcore gaming, then purchase a gaming phone.  The display quality is just amazing and superb.  The size of the phone is quite handy and has a nice grip feeling to hold the leather back.  There is no heating issue found.  Conclusion : This is the must buy phone in 2024. Go for it without any hesitation. 😊❤️\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Good phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Ditched my decision of buying edge 50 fusion at the last minute and went with this. It's a wonderful phone. Performance is good for some one who does routine tasks and not into extreme gaming( though I had no issue with playing PUBg)  Pros: ----- 1. Design and look and color 2. Great Display 3. Small and light form factor 4. Camera 5. OS and Moto AI especially AI generated wallpaper 6. Performance 7. No heating  Cons: ------ 1. Small battery 2. No audio jack  Also was confused between Poinciana and Latte color and trust me Latte is too good in real. Glad I didn't make the wrong choice\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto edge 50 neo is an awesome phone for day to day usage. Despite being smaller battery size, it lasts whole day easily with moderate usage. I used to handle a lot of calls and use watsapp during my office timings with surfing on google, surprisigly it lasts whole day with 40% battery remaining at the evening. Its form factor and design is awesome. Camera is decent. I am using S22 plus as my primary device. But moto's display is awesome, better than S22. Also battery lasts way more than S22 plus. Thanks to its good optimization and LTPO display. Touch and feel is also very nice. No overheating issue. Charging is superfast. Go ahead for it. Its an awesome device for the price.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are looking for a compact phone with good cameras and decent performance and stock android without any ads this phone is for you.  Pros 1.display is really impressive with 1.5k 120 hz ltpo and bezels are so thin 2. Design is very eye pleadings with vegan leather and it is so comfortable to hold 3.battery backup is actually good( I was expecting worse) i got sot 6-7hrs with moderate usage (refresh rate at auto). 4.camera is really good in this price range with 3x telephoto I am addicted using it. Videos comes out really good with no jitters and shaking. 5.ui experience is really good too with no ads and bloatwares and also so many moto features. In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: 1. Delivered within 24 hrs. 2. Perfect in size, easy and comfortable to hold. Cover supplied is not good, risk of mobile getting damaged if dropped. 3. Excellent performance. Fast , sharp colours. 4. Sharp snaps even in low light. 5. Battery capacity is low, had to charge in between, may not go for full day even for moderate use.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Amazing phone... cameras are definitely worth it at this price range....some people are saying reddish tone...yes slightly but it looks really good tbh ... absolutely social media ready pics....and the portraits are top top notch believe me..the only cons are battery life but it's a compact phone we can't expect more...but still It will easily backup for a decent amount of sot...and yeah the camera app lags only major con I've found so far... otherwise the phone is an absolute all rounder...I hope it helps and this is a genuine review fr\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Neo is a nice smartphone with a sleek design, AMOLED display, and a decent camera system that gives a flagship in hand feel. The display is absolutely beautiful with minimal bezels and top colours. And the speakers are also very good but little down on bass. However, performance in not as impressive for long sessions of gaming as it tends to heat up after some but overall there are no stutters or jitters. It offers excellent battery life for light to medium usage and performs well for everyday tasks. For the 1 week I didn't get good battery life then gradually it got better now I am getting very good SOT of 7-9 hrs.  Overall, this phone is a good choice for Light to medium usage like media consumption , photography, casual gaming, multitasking.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone tends to heat up in daily usage, a typical characteristic of a mediatek processor phone.  A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent. Performance while taking photos could have been improved from software perspective.  Migrated from an old phone to this one. All apps got installed, some got missed. Now installing those and logging in into all the apps.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Opinion after using for 16 days:  Great phone at this price, only issue is overheating and slight low battery.  Pros - Everything else is great, except: Cons- 1. Overheating - Phone heats up during charging. It heats up even more than this, when sharing mobile hotspot alone(greater than 10 minutes). Wouldn't recommend mixing these two together. This may be a concern especially during summers.  2. Battery - Battery is a bit less. 5000mAh would've been better. On light usage (2-3 hrs screen time per day), it stretches up to 1.5-2 days. On heavy usage, you might need to charge it twice during a day (especially if you mostly use the camera).  68W charging may compensate for it, but you'd have to turn down the screen refresh rate to 60 Hz, if you're travelling for the entire day and need the juice in your phone, especially during trips/vacations (where camera usage is higher), or just in case, if any emergency occurs.  Coming to the last point, the cover included in the box (semi-hard material, non-TPU/non-Silicone) complements the color of the phone, but it doesn't cover the sides (only covers the corners).\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Very balanced phone for daily use, minor bugs are there (like: when I'm taking screenshot by double tap on the back phone freezes) ,skin tone problem in camera although the camera is good for non human subject photos and when I switch on the flicker prevention the display goes green from one side in low brightness i compared with the same phone such problem is not in that piece. Battery capacity could be increased because most of the people don't use wireless charging in this price range. Overall if you're looking for a compact and balanced smartphone ( not for gaming ) then you can definitely go for this considering the battery performance. Anything to ask you can.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Flipkart BB sale !!! Amazing superfast next day delivery. Product quality is great. Light weight handset, superb screen refresh rate, good camera and excellent design. I appreciate moto for giving charging adaptor inside box. Other wise one has to buy it separately, it saves your expenses.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

I am not sure if there will be a future sw update for the same.  2. I was not expecting that there will be some hang issue which is still there on the phone.  3. Battery performance is ok and i am able to run it for one day including my office emails, calls etc.  4. Screen resolutions and its display is very good and i like the performance of this one.  5. The sound quality i did not like as of now and not feeling for anything of Dolby sound, might be some software update will fix this.  6. Another issue found today which is related to heating when i have used the camera for a long time to capture photos for a long time in a party. And also due to the heat camera app was getting off itself.  7. The touch is very smooth in operating this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Good things:- I would say it's a good choice with this price having a lovely design along with a curved display and a good resolution also battery backup is also not bad according to our usage.  Drawbacks:- Heating issue while using a camera for a bit longer, which is quite easy to understand with this much quality as well as while charging because it has an ultra charging system so it's also acceptable.  Conclusion - Don't delay in going for it, if you are looking up this budget...\n",

Cons: Camera takes 2-3 seconds to start, and lags if quickly zooms in and out. Heating issue, while charging and gaming. Slow charging while in use and if heated, faster charging if left to charge.  Overall good in prince range but could be better.  If upto Ratings then- Camera- 9/10 Charging-7/10 Battery backup- 8/10 Performance- 9/10 Interface- 9/10\n",

The only negative point is that it was taking little time for processing images due to this integration. But the photo quality, my god, is superb.specifically the camera performance during low light is exceptional. The display , features, Dolby system all work well and the phone is a good package at this price range.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: After purchasing this phone, you will truly appreciate its value. At this price point, it offers everything you need. The display is exceptional, and with Gorilla Glass protection, you won't have to worry about durability. The phone's design is both premium and slim, providing a great in-hand feel making it seem like you're holding a high-end device. The camera is outstanding for this price range, with the ability to capture stunning portraits using the 3x telephoto lens (85mm), and the 3x zoom on the normal camera delivers superb photo quality. Performance is also strong, thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor.  Issues (These can be addressed in future software updates): - The camera app takes a significant amount of time to open. - Photo processing time is longer than expected after capturing an image. - Battery optimisation needs improvement, as there is a noticeable battery drain even when the screen is off.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Battery drains fastly comparatively. Overall phone is good, camera/design/ processing everything is excellent. But there is only one issue that battery drains fastly even when the phone is not in use.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: My Honest Review (after using it for more than a week) 1) Display: Before buying this phone I had realme x7 Max which had amoled fhd+ display with 409 PPI and this phone has 393 PPI so I can spot the difference in the sharpness and quality which I missed out during my reasearch. The rest aspects of display are good. 2) Camera: Again, my old phone had 64mp rear so I could see better details after zooming in the clicked picture or live 4k video compared to this phone. But, this phone has good after processing functionality so it might be a bit satisfactory. 3) Software: By far it's good. Did not feel jittery anywhere apart from camera app opening and closing times but it's rare. 4) Battery: I never charge my phone to 100%. I always charge it within the 35-85% range which will help to prolong the life and I'm not a heavy user so I can easily get 5.30 hours of sot before the next charge which roughly takes about 15-20 minutes. And, also I didn't enable the Charge boost to avoid overheating the battery while charging. So, this department is great. 5) others: Didn't face any calling issues, even wifi calling experience is good. Difficulty in finding the right case for the phone to ensure the safety so need to use it carefully. Idle drain 3% at night at 120hz RR, 4%-5% at night at 144hz RR.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola 50 Fusion, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! The camera is excellent, capturing stunning photos with great detail and vibrant colors. The phone is super lightweight, making it easy to carry around without feeling bulky.  One of the standout features for me is the quick charging capability. It saves me so much time and keeps me going throughout the day without constantly worrying about battery life. Another big plus is the absence of bloatware, which means a cleaner and smoother user experience.  The 5G connectivity is top-notch, providing fast and reliable internet speeds. Overall, it's a fantastic phone with great features. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's always room for a bit of improvement. Highly recommended!\n",

However, while holding the phone, it had a slippery feel even with the back cover because it was curved glass. The phone had a stereo speaker, but sound was not clear, punchy\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB): A Sleek Everyday Powerhouse (Review)  You're spot on about the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) being a compelling choice. The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This Phone is the best in the price range, It is as I expected but I have seen a disadvantage till now is that you have to avoid using a uv protector glass (specially glue while installing uv protector) with this phone. Because most of the time it damages the sensors or speakers. And the company also doesn't accept damage caused by using a uv protector glass.\n",

I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

Normal heating is there not much. You can consider this phone without much thinking. Look is awesome.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic product in this price range . Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage . Based on my experience CAMERA-4.5/5 It boost the colors a bit but it does not ruin your pictures. BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone looks good and operates smoothly. The OS is clean Android, the camera is good, and the battery life is strong. However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

The battery will easily last you for a day and even if it doesn't you can use the fast charger to charge your phone quickly. The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.  Good thing is that there is very little bloatware and you can disable that so you will not get any unnecessary notifications at least that is what I have seen so far.

You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

      "Product Name: Motorola Edge 50 Neo (PANTONE Poinciana, 256 GB)  (8 GB RAM)\n",
      "Product Price: ₹23,999\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost. If that sounds like you, it's definitely worth considering.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Yes battery drain fast, but I was looking for compact device and Samsung was out of my range, so purchased this. Please make smaller devices, between 5.5 to 6 inch devices.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This feels really very premium Quality is good at this price point along with 5 years update. The camera is quite good as it offers 3X optical zoom Touch and finish feels premium Charging speed is Really fast with a 68 watt charger Moto gestures are a big Plus It's like an iphone of the Android offering a 5 year update.  Must buy if You are looking for an all rounder phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: MUST KNOW BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE--- 1. DON'T BUY if you are a GAMER, REEL ADDICT OR DOOM SCROLLER. 2. MUST BUY if you want DURABLE LONG LASTING SIMPLE COMPACT PHONE WHICH GETS THE JOB DONE.  Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola Edge 50 Neo ❤️, and it has exceeded my expectations! The sleek design and vibrant display make for a stunning visual experience, while the performance is incredibly smooth, handling all apps and games effortlessly. The camera quality is fantastic, capturing sharp and vivid photos even in low light. Battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of heavy use. I also love the clean Android experience without any bloatware. Overall, this phone offers amazing value for its price, and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This review after using 7 days.  In many reviews, I saw many people saying the camera is not good. But after usage, I can say the camera is not so bad, it's very good, both front and back. Obviously you can't expect a DSLR like photography. It's a phone not a DSLR .  Battery backup with fast charging facility is very good. And RAM optimisation is amazing. It goes full day in moderate usage. If gaming then you should charge twice daily which is quite obvious. And this phone is not for hardcore gaming, if you want hardcore gaming, then purchase a gaming phone.  The display quality is just amazing and superb.  The size of the phone is quite handy and has a nice grip feeling to hold the leather back.  There is no heating issue found.  Conclusion : This is the must buy phone in 2024. Go for it without any hesitation. 😊❤️\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Ditched my decision of buying edge 50 fusion at the last minute and went with this. It's a wonderful phone. Performance is good for some one who does routine tasks and not into extreme gaming( though I had no issue with playing PUBg)  Pros: ----- 1. Design and look and color 2. Great Display 3. Small and light form factor 4. Camera 5. OS and Moto AI especially AI generated wallpaper 6. Performance 7. No heating  Cons: ------ 1. Small battery 2. No audio jack  Also was confused between Poinciana and Latte color and trust me Latte is too good in real. Glad I didn't make the wrong choice\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto edge 50 neo is an awesome phone for day to day usage. Despite being smaller battery size, it lasts whole day easily with moderate usage. I used to handle a lot of calls and use watsapp during my office timings with surfing on google, surprisigly it lasts whole day with 40% battery remaining at the evening. Its form factor and design is awesome. Camera is decent. I am using S22 plus as my primary device. But moto's display is awesome, better than S22. Also battery lasts way more than S22 plus. Thanks to its good optimization and LTPO display. Touch and feel is also very nice. No overheating issue. Charging is superfast. Go ahead for it. Its an awesome device for the price.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are looking for a compact phone with good cameras and decent performance and stock android without any ads this phone is for you.  Pros 1.display is really impressive with 1.5k 120 hz ltpo and bezels are so thin 2. Design is very eye pleadings with vegan leather and it is so comfortable to hold 3.battery backup is actually good( I was expecting worse) i got sot 6-7hrs with moderate usage (refresh rate at auto). 4.camera is really good in this price range with 3x telephoto I am addicted using it. Videos comes out really good with no jitters and shaking. 5.ui experience is really good too with no ads and bloatwares and also so many moto features. In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",

People complaining about the battery due to its small size but in my device I'm getting more than one day battery backup with moderate use. Dont know how but it's 4310mah battery performance is better than my samsung s20fe with 4500 mah and other mobiles with 5000mah batteries. No overheating issue, no network issue. Its good deal.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

The display is absolutely beautiful with minimal bezels and top colours. And the speakers are also very good but little down on bass. However, performance in not as impressive for long sessions of gaming as it tends to heat up after some but overall there are no stutters or jitters. It offers excellent battery life for light to medium usage and performs well for everyday tasks.

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone tends to heat up in daily usage, a typical characteristic of a mediatek processor phone.  A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent. Performance while taking photos could have been improved from software perspective.  Migrated from an old phone to this one. All apps got installed, some got missed. Now installing those and logging in into all the apps.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Opinion after using for 16 days:  Great phone at this price, only issue is overheating and slight low battery.  Pros - Everything else is great, except: Cons- 1. Overheating - Phone heats up during charging. It heats up even more than this, when sharing mobile hotspot alone(greater than 10 minutes). Wouldn't recommend mixing these two together. This may be a concern especially during summers.  2. Battery - Battery is a bit less. 5000mAh would've been better. On light usage (2-3 hrs screen time per day), it stretches up to 1.5-2 days. On heavy usage, you might need to charge it twice during a day (especially if you mostly use the camera).  68W charging may compensate for it, but you'd have to turn down the screen refresh rate to 60 Hz, if you're travelling for the entire day and need the juice in your phone, especially during trips/vacations (where camera usage is higher), or just in case, if any emergency occurs.  Coming to the last point, the cover included in the box (semi-hard material, non-TPU/non-Silicone) complements the color of the phone, but it doesn't cover the sides (only covers the corners).\n",

Battery capacity could be increased because most of the people don't use wireless charging in this price range. Overall if you're looking for a compact and balanced smartphone ( not for gaming ) then you can definitely go for this considering the battery performance. Anything to ask you can.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Flipkart BB sale !!! Amazing superfast next day delivery. Product quality is great. Light weight handset, superb screen refresh rate, good camera and excellent design.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

The screen is good camera portrait shots are also amazing. performance is also good in daily uses. Not recommended for gamers.

Battery:- I m writing this review after 12 hrs of not plugged into the charger.. still left with around 50% battery  Charging. 15w wireless.. 68w wired.  Overall a very good phone for this price.

IP 65 and great build quality 5. Decent cameras  Cons: 1. Camera app does not load quickly. Not sure if it's a bug but it takes too long to launch camera. 2. The processor is average. I don't play games but even while processing photos it takes a couple of seconds to prepare the final image.  Overall a decent all round phone which handles your daily tasks pretty neat.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing a review after using it for more than a week.  1. In the current situation, we are having a bigger lag issue in camera opening to capture any photo. I am not sure if there will be a future sw update for the same.  2. I was not expecting that there will be some hang issue which is still there on the phone.  3. Battery performance is ok and i am able to run it for one day including my office emails, calls etc.  4. Screen resolutions and its display is very good and i like the performance of this one.  5. The sound quality i did not like as of now and not feeling for anything of Dolby sound, might be some software update will fix this.  6. Another issue found today which is related to heating when i have used the camera for a long time to capture photos for a long time in a party. And also due to the heat camera app was getting off itself.  7. The touch is very smooth in operating this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: After purchasing this phone, you will truly appreciate its value. At this price point, it offers everything you need. The display is exceptional, and with Gorilla Glass protection, you won't have to worry about durability. The phone's design is both premium and slim, providing a great in-hand feel making it seem like you're holding a high-end device. The camera is outstanding for this price range, with the ability to capture stunning portraits using the 3x telephoto lens (85mm), and the 3x zoom on the normal camera delivers superb photo quality. Performance is also strong, thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor.  Issues (These can be addressed in future software updates): - The camera app takes a significant amount of time to open. - Photo processing time is longer than expected after capturing an image. - Battery optimisation needs improvement, as there is a noticeable battery drain even when the screen is off.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB): A Sleek Everyday Powerhouse (Review)  You're spot on about the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) being a compelling choice. The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I have liked this phone very much. It is very thin and very light too but what I liked the most is its girly hot pink look and its back leather finish. I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

If you are switching flat display to curved display, initially you may feel uncomfortable but later you will be used to it. One more thing few people complaining about heating issue, I don't feel it. Normal heating is there not much. You can consider this phone without much thinking. Look is awesome.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic product in this price range . Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage . Based on my experience CAMERA-4.5/5 It boost the colors a bit but it does not ruin your pictures. BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: It's a nicely designed phone for day to day use. Good display and camera, decent performance without any lag. Not much heating except while charging it gets little wamer.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone looks good and operates smoothly. The OS is clean Android, the camera is good, and the battery life is strong. However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

The battery will easily last you for a day and even if it doesn't you can use the fast charger to charge your phone quickly. The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.  Good thing is that there is very little bloatware and you can disable that so you will not get any unnecessary notifications at least that is what I have seen so far. Overall a complete value for money device\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The photo is a sample , turned on all post processing. The phone seems like a complete package. Very good display, a bit taller. You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Reviewing after 2days of using Moto Edge 50pro (125W, 12gb RAM variant) -  Display - 10/10 Battery - 8/10 Camera - 8/10 Charging - 9/10  Pros - Light weight, premiumness, flagship features  Cons- Lots of heating issues while charging, booting, long time scrolling, Battery drains little quick as expected.  Charging speed(125W): 0-50% in 11min 0-80% in 20mins 0-100% in 29mins.  This phone is very good as per the specs provided. You can go for it. I hope heating issues will be resolved in future updates.  Everything depends on usage and P2P, the above views are my observations and may differ.\n",

Design: The design is very eye-catching and, feels very good and confident to hold in hand.  2. Camera: Camera set up is really awesome and best in this segment. I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.  3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.  4. Battery: Battery back is good for one full day by keeping the internet all the time on. I especially want to talk about a 125W charger which really charges mobile in less time.  I am really happy with this mobile and recommend buying it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Point-wise review for the Motorola Edge 50 Pro:  1. Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch P-OLED display offers vibrant colors and crisp details. 2. Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Superb Design Trendy Look Decent Display Fast Charger All these are good...  But Heating Issue makes it hard to Hold... Immediate bug fix needed...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.  The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice as expected! Highly recommended  The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely Premium/flagship phone. i have used iphones from last 4 years and recently used S24 and nothing phone 2 for months as primary device. Edge 50 pro feel beautiful choice it is not as premium as iphone or s24 but you won't regret if you bought this.  Extremely beautiful display, i think it is as beautiful as s24 and iphones display. 10/10 for this extremely good display i can't believe i bought this for 30k. i feel same beauty as iPhones. believe me, display will not disappoint you even if you use iPhones....  Performance : probably decent not as good as iPhones or any premium phones. it's just justify the price but don't expect much.  Design? : I am not a fan of this awkward 4 camera set design but yeah built quality is fairly good so thumbs up.  Battery! I haven't got extremely good battery life , expect 6 hours sot probably.  Camera 📸 No way guys, This is something i can say better than nothing phone 2 or oneplus 12r ... i am stunned however it captures pics and later process it but outcome always suprises me... extremely good 😊 but videos are just fair don't expect much as well.  Heating Issues? i haven't faced any heating issue at all I don't know how people are complaint about heating and display issues... don't worry much about these things    Conclusion : If your budget is tight or want a premium phone in lesser price just get this one. Keep in mind you can't expect extremely good performance like flagship. decent performance, premium display and built. that's all you get. You won't feel post purchase regret 😚  If you are confused and you don't do heavy task all the time just buy this i can guarantee you won't regret. even people like me who uses flagships i am suprised how good this phone is.. i am using this as primary device.   Wishing you best buy. ✨\n",

For office use, I am getting a minimum 28 hours of battery backup. 125W charger takes 30min to change from 10-100%. The camera quality is really superb. The display is also good. The only problem which is observed is - screen guard and mobile cover provided with mobile are very poor quality and not for use. The camera takes some 6-8 seconds to process the picture. It may be solved in the next update. Worth for money. Thanks to Flipkart for quick and smooth service.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Battery: I wake up in the morning charge my phone and come to the office, watch a movie on the train, use the office Wi-Fi all day, the phone is used enough, on the way home to watch a movie, come back home and use the Wi-Fi, my mobile data usage is very low. About 2-3 hours all day, but when I wake up the next day, the phone has above 40 percent charge, tell me if it's a good battery or a bad battery. Camera: I have been using S21FE5G mobile for 2 years so my Samsung was best except for portrait mode, but one more thing my Samsung camera app was slow, which this phone doesn't have, it is very fast. Performance: I was scared to buy after seeing negative reviews in many places that UFS 2.1 is very slow but after using it for 10 days I couldn't feel the slowness from any angle. If there is any glitch, it is from the UI, it will be fixed when the software update comes. Charger/Temperature: I saw reviews in many places that there is overheat issue but when I set up the phone it got hot but I don't get overheat all day even from non AC and when I charge it with 125-watt charger the phone gets hot that's normal there shouldn't be so much controversy about it, if I Let me give you a small example. My Samsung phone charger was 25 watts. When my phone was charged below 15% to 100%, both the charger and the phone would be very hot, so I think it's normal. Sound: There are stereo speakers, the sound is strong but the quality could be better. Display: When I bought the phone I didn't even know if it had any display protection but Motorola chat support confirmed to me that it has Gorilla Glass 5 protection which I have saved a screenshot of.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Reviewing after 2days of using Moto Edge 50pro (125W, 12gb RAM variant) -  Display - 10/10 Battery - 8/10 Camera - 8/10 Charging - 9/10  Pros - Light weight, premiumness, flagship features  Cons- Lots of heating issues while charging, booting, long time scrolling, Battery drains little quick as expected.  Charging speed(125W): 0-50% in 11min 0-80% in 20mins 0-100% in 29mins.  This phone is very good as per the specs provided. You can go for it. I hope heating issues will be resolved in future updates.  Everything depends on usage and P2P, the above views are my observations and may differ.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this mobile for the last 6 days and overall I am very Happy with this mobile.  1. Design: The design is very eye-catching and, feels very good and confident to hold in hand.  2. Camera: Camera set up is really awesome and best in this segment. I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.  3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.  4. Battery: Battery back is good for one full day by keeping the internet all the time on. I especially want to talk about a 125W charger which really charges mobile in less time.  I am really happy with this mobile and recommend buying it.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Just received my moto edge 50 pro yesterday. Look wise mobile is very good. All accessories were in the box, although the back cover is kind of useless. The 125W charger is charging mobile fast as advertised by moto. As of now the performance looks great. Camera is great specially front camera. Colors are quite realistic. I've given 4 star as of now, will update my review after few weeks of use.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Point-wise review for the Motorola Edge 50 Pro:  1. Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch P-OLED display offers vibrant colors and crisp details. 2. Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Excellent product Display is awesome Batery is good Camara is excellent for this price\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is Good. But , battery 🔋 optimisation is not good. Because I am not a heavy user, I still charge my mobile minimum 3 times per day. Maybe it' will be solved in the next update.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good performance\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Superb Design Trendy Look Decent Display Fast Charger All these are good...  But Heating Issue makes it hard to Hold... Immediate bug fix needed...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely Premium/flagship phone. i have used iphones from last 4 years and recently used S24 and nothing phone 2 for months as primary device. Edge 50 pro feel beautiful choice it is not as premium as iphone or s24 but you won't regret if you bought this.  Extremely beautiful display, i think it is as beautiful as s24 and iphones display. 10/10 for this extremely good display i can't believe i bought this for 30k. i feel same beauty as iPhones. believe me, display will not disappoint you even if you use iPhones....  Performance : probably decent not as good as iPhones or any premium phones. it's just justify the price but don't expect much.  Design? : I am not a fan of this awkward 4 camera set design but yeah built quality is fairly good so thumbs up.  Battery! I haven't got extremely good battery life , expect 6 hours sot probably.  Camera 📸 No way guys, This is something i can say better than nothing phone 2 or oneplus 12r ... i am stunned however it captures pics and later process it but outcome always suprises me... extremely good 😊 but videos are just fair don't expect much as well.  Heating Issues? i haven't faced any heating issue at all I don't know how people are complaint about heating and display issues... don't worry much about these things    Conclusion : If your budget is tight or want a premium phone in lesser price just get this one. Keep in mind you can't expect extremely good performance like flagship. decent performance, premium display and built. that's all you get. You won't feel post purchase regret 😚  If you are confused and you don't do heavy task all the time just buy this i can guarantee you won't regret. even people like me who uses flagships i am suprised how good this phone is.. i am using this as primary device.

The only problem which is observed is - screen guard and mobile cover provided with mobile are very poor quality and not for use. The camera takes some 6-8 seconds to process the picture.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Battery: I wake up in the morning charge my phone and come to the office, watch a movie on the train, use the office Wi-Fi all day, the phone is used enough, on the way home to watch a movie, come back home and use the Wi-Fi, my mobile data usage is very low. About 2-3 hours all day, but when I wake up the next day, the phone has above 40 percent charge, tell me if it's a good battery or a bad battery. Camera: I have been using S21FE5G mobile for 2 years so my Samsung was best except for portrait mode, but one more thing my Samsung camera app was slow, which this phone doesn't have, it is very fast. Performance: I was scared to buy after seeing negative reviews in many places that UFS 2.1 is very slow but after using it for 10 days I couldn't feel the slowness from any angle. If there is any glitch, it is from the UI, it will be fixed when the software update comes. Charger/Temperature: I saw reviews in many places that there is overheat issue but when I set up the phone it got hot but I don't get overheat all day even from non AC and when I charge it with 125-watt charger the phone gets hot that's normal there shouldn't be so much controversy about it, if I Let me give you a small example. My Samsung phone charger was 25 watts. When my phone was charged below 15% to 100%, both the charger and the phone would be very hot, so I think it's normal. Sound: There are stereo speakers, the sound is strong but the quality could be better. Display: When I bought the phone I didn't even know if it had any display protection but Motorola chat support confirmed to me that it has Gorilla Glass 5 protection which I have saved a screenshot of.\n",

Videos are good sometimes it adds color which is not natural. Also the battery is not good you have to carry a charger with you. Thought charging is fast. Also while charging the phone heats a lot even if you're not using it while charging. Overall it is a good phone but the price range is high compared to other phones compared to the performance. I hope the moto will fix these issues with updates\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's a nice product. The camera is good. Bit sometimes lag. Performance is good. Battery backup is not so good initially as high usage. Later when it becomes normal usage almost 1 day back up. Charging is super fast within 25-30 mins with a 125w ch arger. The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience. Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times. Overall it's good purchase\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's first day yet, camera is awesome, rest of the feature yet to establish, screen guard has been applied already, but no tempered glass in box, charging is good, but mobile feels heated little bit, have to see how it is on further usage..\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: My Review...  1 - I compared the camera of Motorola Edge 50 Pro with the recently launched mobiles like Vivo T3 Pro and Mi Redmi Note 13 Pro. The camera of Motorola Edge 50 Pro is much better than both the mobiles, it is fantastic and amazing, I am very satisfied.  2 ) The battery backup is very good. The mobile gets fully charged in 20 to 25 minutes and gives a backup of 30 to 32 hours. There is no heating issue in the mobile.  3 ) The look of the mobile is premium. I am very impressed with the Curve display. It is very smooth to use. The processor is very good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm giving honest reviews after using it for more than a week.  I'm mentioning cons first..  1. The battery is not efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day. If you are a normal user and use it on only a 4g\\lte network then you may use it for a whole working day. But if u are heavy user you have to charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times. It totally depends up to your uses and needs  ###. [PROS] But you will get a 68 watts fast charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only in 45 minutes.  2. so many peoples are worried about its heating issues... I don't think its a cons coz i used iPhone 13 for photography it also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry its a normal things.  But if you are heavy using it at outside in the sun or any tampered area then try to avoid it.  If you use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or atleast in fornt of fan then there is no heating issue..  3. Some youtuber said if you aren't use tempered glass for the very fist day it gets screen scratches but its totally false ... I use it for whole long day without using tempered glass but my phone was fine and it comes with gorilla glass 3 typs glass. So don't worry display material quality is totally fine... But try to use tempered glass as soon as possible for your safety 4. unfortunately I'm glad to say there are no cons in this phone .  Pros .  These phone gives you full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2. Looks is outstanding people will notice your phone atleast once. 3. Ram management is perfect. still not found any choppy or laggs 4. Camera quality is overall no doubly fabulous in this price range No need to think about camera quality or video quality. 5. Multitasking and gaming performance is good . I played cod mobile and it runs perfectly. 6. Ip68 ratings gives you freedom to use worry free .. 7. Sound quality is noice and Crips 8. Most important network quality... And its just awesome I'm getting most of the time 5G++ signal in my area and others area most of the time 4G+ 9. Charging is supra fast no need to worry about charging 10. Its a handy phone it will fits any size of hand.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: It's a really good phone for regular usage. If you are not a heavy gamer and don't do very performance intensive tasks it can be the perfect option for you. The display is beautiful so is the design. The camera works quite well and is consistent. Do put on a screen guard asap because it is quite prone to scratches. Aside from that the phone heats up a little while charging and will do so during the set up procedure owing to internal tasks but it will subside overtime. Best thing about it is the OS, it's smooth and without any hitches. Even the additional details and functions really elevate your experience. So if you want a phone that is an all rounder and gives the best experience during regular usage go for it.\n",

But now after updating Feb security patch with bug fixes this is literally showing its full potential. Now there is no heating issue, battery lasts as long as 20-30 hrs in nnormal to moderate use. And the issue with selfie camera was slaved by using Gcam. So now I'm a happy to own this device. P.s. IP68 is 🔥 you can see the underwater pics here.\n",

That's useful feature to cool down your phone. Overall experience is good. At this price point what to expect more than this !! Motorola is coming in form once again!!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The brand new motorola edge 40 neo comes along with 5000 mah battery but it fails to reach at least 6 hours of SOT. Hope it will be rectified in upcoming update. Rather than battery, Every thing is looking good. One more thing is I didn't receive any update till now. It can be improved. Motorola is absolutely booming in mid range segment and also in foldable market. Hope it can occupy more than 50 percent market share in Indian mobile market if it continues launching value for money products....\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is good for moderate users. I'm quite unsatisfied with its camera and battery. The camera makes the photo quite over saturated. It may be that someone likes it but I personally don't. Otherwise the phone is good. It feels buttery smooth in use as it comes with 144hz refresh rate. It's look and premiumness is just wow. One can easily use it with a single hand.  One more problem I faced with it is of tempered glass which is not easily available in the market and I don't prefer buying it online as it doesn't comes with return or exchange policy and I have to accept the product whatever comes.  Overall the product is good.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm giving honest reviews after using it for more than a week.  I'm mentioning cons first..  1. The battery is not efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day. If you are a normal user and use it on only a 4g\\lte network then you may use it for a whole working day. But if u are heavy user you have to charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times. It totally depends up to your uses and needs  ###. [PROS] But you will get a 68 watts fast charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only in 45 minutes.  2. so many peoples are worried about its heating issues... I don't think its a cons coz i used iPhone 13 for photography it also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry its a normal things.  But if you are heavy using it at outside in the sun or any tampered area then try to avoid it.  If you use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or atleast in fornt of fan then there is no heating issue..  3. Some youtuber said if you aren't use tempered glass for the very fist day it gets screen scratches but its totally false ... I use it for whole long day without using tempered glass but my phone was fine and it comes with gorilla glass 3 typs glass. So don't worry display material quality is totally fine... But try to use tempered glass as soon as possible for your safety 4. unfortunately I'm glad to say there are no cons in this phone .  Pros .  These phone gives you full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2. Looks is outstanding people will notice your phone atleast once. 3. Ram management is perfect. still not found any choppy or laggs 4. Camera quality is overall no doubly fabulous in this price range No need to think about camera quality or video quality. 5. Multitasking and gaming performance is good . I played cod mobile and it runs perfectly. 6. Ip68 ratings gives you freedom to use worry free .. 7. Sound quality is noice and Crips 8. Most important network quality... And its just awesome I'm getting most of the time 5G++ signal in my area and others area most of the time 4G+ 9. Charging is supra fast no need to worry about charging 10. Its a handy phone it will fits any size of hand.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: It's a really good phone for regular usage. If you are not a heavy gamer and don't do very performance intensive tasks it can be the perfect option for you. The display is beautiful so is the design. The camera works quite well and is consistent. Do put on a screen guard asap because it is quite prone to scratches. Aside from that the phone heats up a little while charging and will do so during the set up procedure owing to internal tasks but it will subside overtime. Best thing about it is the OS, it's smooth and without any hitches. Even the additional details and functions really elevate your experience. So if you want a phone that is an all rounder and gives the best experience during regular usage go for it.\n",

But now after updating Feb security patch with bug fixes this is literally showing its full potential. Now there is no heating issue, battery lasts as long as 20-30 hrs in nnormal to moderate use. And the issue with selfie camera was slaved by using Gcam. So now I'm a happy to own this device. P.s. IP68 is 🔥 you can see the underwater pics here.\n",

Display- display is good and feels premium Battery - Battery performance not good at all discharge in just 4-5 hours of regular uses. Heating issue is also major problem in this mobile . Camera is good at this price but colour is oversaturated Btw you can go for it for normal use otherwise for heavy use this is not good.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Everything's fine except battery performance. Motorola should have worked more on battery life, it doesn't feel like 5000 mAh tbh. It's around 4000, it feels. Overall Edge 40 Neo steals my heart in design, display, stereo speakers and camera.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Quality product made by Motorola. Allrounder phone. good for daily use. Display and design is fabulous. Everyone keeps eye on it. But concern is it's battery backup. Need to charge 2 times if you use normally. And heating issue is also there. Now I understood why they gave IP68 rating. Use it for gaming for a while and drop it in the water. That's useful feature to cool down your phone. Overall experience is good. At this price point what to expect more than this !! Motorola is coming in form once again!!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The brand new motorola edge 40 neo comes along with 5000 mah battery but it fails to reach at least 6 hours of SOT. Hope it will be rectified in upcoming update. Rather than battery, Every thing is looking good. One more thing is I didn't receive any update till now. It can be improved. Motorola is absolutely booming in mid range segment and also in foldable market. Hope it can occupy more than 50 percent market share in Indian mobile market if it continues launching value for money products....\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is good for moderate users. I'm quite unsatisfied with its camera and battery. The camera makes the photo quite over saturated. It may be that someone likes it but I personally don't. Otherwise the phone is good. It feels buttery smooth in use as it comes with 144hz refresh rate. It's look and premiumness is just wow. One can easily use it with a single hand.  One more problem I faced with it is of tempered glass which is not easily available in the market and I don't prefer buying it online as it doesn't comes with return or exchange policy and I have to accept the product whatever comes.  Overall the product is good.\n",

Its battery life is impressive, ensuring you stay connected throughout the day without worry with it's 68W fast charging.

      "Rating: 4, Review: Decent good light weight phone (do not expect more). Got this mobile on 2nd release without having any user reviews, So far all good with 1. battery 5k mah serves a day 2. Performance is fast (Max ram utilized, 256 gb majority of the pre-installed apps consumed). Android 14 is much better and secure with Google 3. Design is good and light weight 4. Display and fingerprint are fine  5. Camera okay (didn't meet our expectations) 6. Memory slot should have been provided  Overall 4/5, you can go for it!  To Flipkart, you charge 59 for secure package but what secure it is ? Mobile came in a normal cart box without any protection like bubble wrap or bubble gels inside box to protect device. Potential chances of damages and tampering of cart box easily. Needs improvement with packing secure.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Decent good light weight phone (do not expect more). Got this mobile on 2nd release without having any user reviews, So far all good with 1. battery 5k mah serves a day 2. Performance is fast (Max ram utilized, 256 gb majority of the pre-installed apps consumed). Android 14 is much better and secure with Google 3. Design is good and light weight 4. Display and fingerprint are fine  5. Camera okay (didn't meet our expectations) 6. Memory slot should have been provided  Overall 4/5, you can go for it!  To Flipkart, you charge 59 for secure package but what secure it is ? Mobile came in a normal cart box without any protection like bubble wrap or bubble gels inside box to protect device. Potential chances of damages and tampering of cart box easily. Needs improvement with packing secure.\n",

Sound is not loud as dual speakers. 2. In this budget 2 megapixel camera makes no sense.  Final verdict- I have shared evening low light photos for you to take a look. overall this phone is very good in this segments. If your budget is within twenty thousand then you can take it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I am writing review after using 4 days.  Pros  1. Design is awesome. Feel very light weight and very sleek design. Feel very comfortable and have perfect grip. 2. Camera is perfect. You can capture perfect picture in this price range. 3. Network connection is perfect. Having no any issue related network. 4. Display - it's ok. Needs some more colour detailing in this price range but overall perfect.There is no much more use of peak brightness it's all are advertising propoganda. 5. Heating - After playing more than 1 hrs of BGMI face no any heating issue. Little bit hit which is accepted.   Cons  1. Battery backup is little bit disappointed. Need some more improvement. It's seem as like 5000 mah battery. I has been using poco m2 pro since 4 yrs (5000mah)who provide same battery backup. 2. Haptic is not as like OnePlus provide.need some more improvement. 3. Fingerprint response is slightly slow. You need to place your finger for some second to unlock and fingerprint sensor is bottom of the screen which quite difficult to open the lock. 4. Speaker loudness is low and provide single stereo speaker which is quite disappointing. At least give dual stereo speaker. But the voice clarity is good. 5. Quality of back cover is low.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I am writing review after using 4 days.  Pros  1. Design is awesome. Feel very light weight and very sleek design. Feel very comfortable and have perfect grip. 2. Camera is perfect. You can capture perfect picture in this price range. 3. Network connection is perfect. Having no any issue related network. 4. Display - it's ok. Needs some more colour detailing in this price range but overall perfect.There is no much more use of peak brightness it's all are advertising propoganda. 5. Heating - After playing more than 1 hrs of BGMI face no any heating issue. Little bit hit which is accepted.   Cons  1. Battery backup is little bit disappointed. Need some more improvement. It's seem as like 5000 mah battery. I has been using poco m2 pro since 4 yrs (5000mah)who provide same battery backup. 2. Haptic is not as like OnePlus provide.need some more improvement. 3. Fingerprint response is slightly slow. You need to place your finger for some second to unlock and fingerprint sensor is bottom of the screen which quite difficult to open the lock. 4. Speaker loudness is low and provide single stereo speaker which is quite disappointing. At least give dual stereo speaker. But the voice clarity is good. 5. Quality of back cover is low.\n",

Camera is perfect. You can capture perfect picture in this price range. 3. Network connection is perfect. Having no any issue related network. 4. Display - it's ok. Needs some more colour detailing in this price range but overall perfect.There is no much more use of peak brightness it's all are advertising propoganda. 5. Heating - After playing more than 1 hrs of BGMI face no any heating issue. Little bit hit which is accepted.   Cons  1. Battery backup is little bit disappointed. Need some more improvement. It's seem as like 5000 mah battery. I has been using poco m2 pro since 4 yrs (5000mah)who provide same battery backup. 2. Haptic is not as like OnePlus provide.need some more improvement. 3. Fingerprint response is slightly slow. You need to place your finger for some second to unlock and fingerprint sensor is bottom of the screen which quite difficult to open the lock. 4. Speaker loudness is low and provide single stereo speaker which is quite disappointing. At least give dual stereo speaker. But the voice clarity is good. 5. Quality of back cover is low.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very Powerful Processor, Impressive Cameras- Front And Rear- Could Even Be A Contender To S23 FE Except Probably Only Video Stabilization, Curved But Stunning and Crisp Display, and Reliable Battery After Optimization/Updates.  After a few days of usage, I can tell that the phone is pretty powerful in terms of performance. I did not experience any lags. The display is stunning and clear but the curved screen is not something I am a big fan of generally. The cameras are really good with detailed shots turning up on both front and rear cameras. There are also a ton of features to be explored. Even the videos are decent thanks to OIS and stabilization. Night mode also seemed quite powerful. If you take into account both front and rear cameras, it might as well be a contender to Samsung S23 FE. Battery life initially seemed poor, as though it were draining fast, but with a few personal tweaks and perhaps updates, the battery life has gotten better. Now, it feels reliable.  My only complaints would be the lack of a hybrid SIM slot for microSD support. A 3.5 mm jack would have been nice.  Overall, a very balanced and capable smartphone to buy in the 30k price segment. You can compare this one with Motorola Edge 50 Pro, Samsung S23 FE, One Plus Nord 4, and Realme GT 6T before buying this one because they are all very good as well.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: First of all the phone is looking classy and modern thanks to its design and super smooth performance based on my 4 days of usage so far battery is great I am getting 7 to 8 hours of sot on regular basis... There are too many pros to share so let me tell you the bad things about ... cons 1.Pathetic vibration motor I shifted to vivo from Xiaomi I am a Xiaomi fan and the haptics that mi use is just lovable the haptics on vivo is of third quality it feels ghrrrr ghrrrr it matters to me as I type heavily I had to turn of the vibration on keyboard.... 2.camera is on okay ish side if lighting conditions are will enough it gives you good images but in night time it looses overall quality the verdict Is you will like the camera camera part sorted for most of us the good part is camera app is super fast you will like it.. .. 3. Funtouch os feels slow in terms of fast swiping like swiping from home screen to apps windows . 4.Sound quality is not at par I have used Mi11x for 3..5 years and the sound quality is top notch due to Dolby Atmos but you won't see Dolby in T3 ultra and the sound is decent but not the best at this price range .. 5. App crashes a lot whenever something heavily runs on an app it closes automatically you have to again open it ... Verdict overall there are pros and cons in every phone but you are getting a value for money mobile around 30k go for it if you like camera and consume lot of content.looks and performance will make you feel love with this but at the moment you type something it gives you the feeling of 10k mobile....\n",

Portrait and night mode is really exceptional but again color science is not upto the mark in other departments. Battery is long lasting however drains quickly with respect to it's size. Charging is quick Software is mostly clean. It will feel a downgrade if u r switching from Samsung... however it's value for money with perfect balance of performance battery and camera at this price point.\n",

Display and sound improve your multimedia experience. Overall conclusion is that this phone never disappoint point you in any scenario. This phone looks like v40 pro. Same processor same built and design only difference is that an additional sensor of camera is 50mp ultra wide and 50 mp telephoto. But overall V40 pro is not worthy and not justify their price. This handset is value for money.\n",

There are better display panels in market with Lil higher range like One plus 12 or Realme GT6 or Xiaomi 13 phones.  Infact Vivo V40 display is tuned differently and is better than T3 ultra.  Some bloatware available but can be uninstalled.  Cooling mgmt is much better than many phones.  This is not a Camera phone but that's okay. Edit your pictures or videos later.  Best part about phone is it's very comfortable for hands. Your fingers (Pinky) or thumb or any other doesn't get strained.  Meditek processor giving smooth experience  Speakers are also good.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very Powerful Processor, Impressive Cameras- Front And Rear- Could Even Be A Contender To S23 FE Except Probably Only Video Stabilization, Curved But Stunning and Crisp Display, and Reliable Battery After Optimization/Updates.  After a few days of usage, I can tell that the phone is pretty powerful in terms of performance. I did not experience any lags. The display is stunning and clear but the curved screen is not something I am a big fan of generally. The cameras are really good with detailed shots turning up on both front and rear cameras. There are also a ton of features to be explored. Even the videos are decent thanks to OIS and stabilization. Night mode also seemed quite powerful. If you take into account both front and rear cameras, it might as well be a contender to Samsung S23 FE. Battery life initially seemed poor, as though it were draining fast, but with a few personal tweaks and perhaps updates, the battery life has gotten better. Now, it feels reliable.  My only complaints would be the lack of a hybrid SIM slot for microSD support. A 3.5 mm jack would have been nice.  Overall, a very balanced and capable smartphone to buy in the 30k price segment. You can compare this one with Motorola Edge 50 Pro, Samsung S23 FE, One Plus Nord 4, and Realme GT 6T before buying this one because they are all very good as well.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: First of all the phone is looking classy and modern thanks to its design and super smooth performance based on my 4 days of usage so far battery is great I am getting 7 to 8 hours of sot on regular basis... There are too many pros to share so let me tell you the bad things about ... cons 1.Pathetic vibration motor I shifted to vivo from Xiaomi I am a Xiaomi fan and the haptics that mi use is just lovable the haptics on vivo is of third quality it feels ghrrrr ghrrrr it matters to me as I type heavily I had to turn of the vibration on keyboard.... 2.camera is on okay ish side if lighting conditions are will enough it gives you good images but in night time it looses overall quality the verdict Is you will like the camera camera part sorted for most of us the good part is camera app is super fast you will like it.. .. 3. Funtouch os feels slow in terms of fast swiping like swiping from home screen to apps windows . 4.Sound quality is not at par I have used Mi11x for 3..5 years and the sound quality is top notch due to Dolby Atmos but you won't see Dolby in T3 ultra and the sound is decent but not the best at this price range .. 5. App crashes a lot whenever something heavily runs on an app it closes automatically you have to again open it ... Verdict overall there are pros and cons in every phone but you are getting a value for money mobile around 30k go for it if you like camera and consume lot of content.looks and performance will make you feel love with this but at the moment you type something it gives you the feeling of 10k mobile....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Design and built is really premium. Feels extremely fast and lag free. Display is large and vibrant but color calibration is not up to mark. Camera is good. Portrait and night mode is really exceptional but again color science is not upto the mark in other departments. Battery is long lasting however drains quickly with respect to it's size. Charging is quick Software is mostly clean. It will feel a downgrade if u r switching from Samsung... however it's value for money with perfect balance of performance battery and camera at this price point.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Front camera is very good back need more improvement for punchy colour. Battery backup is superb. Processor is just like a wow. Display and sound improve your multimedia experience. Overall conclusion is that this phone never disappoint point you in any scenario. This phone looks like v40 pro. Same processor same built and design only difference is that an additional sensor of camera is 50mp ultra wide and 50 mp telephoto. But overall V40 pro is not worthy and not justify their price. This handset is value for money.\n",

Portrait and night mode is really exceptional but again color science is not upto the mark in other departments. Battery is long lasting however drains quickly with respect to it's size.

It will feel a downgrade if u r switching from Samsung... however it's value for money with perfect balance of performance battery and camera at this price point.\n",

Same processor same built and design only difference is that an additional sensor of camera is 50mp ultra wide and 50 mp telephoto. But overall V40 pro is not worthy and not justify their price.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very Powerful Processor, Impressive Cameras- Front And Rear- Could Even Be A Contender To S23 FE Except Probably Only Video Stabilization, Curved But Stunning and Crisp Display, and Reliable Battery After Optimization/Updates.  After a few days of usage, I can tell that the phone is pretty powerful in terms of performance. I did not experience any lags. The display is stunning and clear but the curved screen is not something I am a big fan of generally. The cameras are really good with detailed shots turning up on both front and rear cameras. There are also a ton of features to be explored. Even the videos are decent thanks to OIS and stabilization. Night mode also seemed quite powerful. If you take into account both front and rear cameras, it might as well be a contender to Samsung S23 FE. Battery life initially seemed poor, as though it were draining fast, but with a few personal tweaks and perhaps updates, the battery life has gotten better. Now, it feels reliable.  My only complaints would be the lack of a hybrid SIM slot for microSD support. A 3.5 mm jack would have been nice.  Overall, a very balanced and capable smartphone to buy in the 30k price segment. You can compare this one with Motorola Edge 50 Pro, Samsung S23 FE, One Plus Nord 4, and Realme GT 6T before buying this one because they are all very good as well.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: First of all the phone is looking classy and modern thanks to its design and super smooth performance based on my 4 days of usage so far battery is great I am getting 7 to 8 hours of sot on regular basis... There are too many pros to share so let me tell you the bad things about ... cons 1.Pathetic vibration motor I shifted to vivo from Xiaomi I am a Xiaomi fan and the haptics that mi use is just lovable the haptics on vivo is of third quality it feels ghrrrr ghrrrr it matters to me as I type heavily I had to turn of the vibration on keyboard.... 2.camera is on okay ish side if lighting conditions are will enough it gives you good images but in night time it looses overall quality the verdict Is you will like the camera camera part sorted for most of us the good part is camera app is super fast you will like it.. .. 3. Funtouch os feels slow in terms of fast swiping like swiping from home screen to apps windows . 4.Sound quality is not at par I have used Mi11x for 3..5 years and the sound quality is top notch due to Dolby Atmos but you won't see Dolby in T3 ultra and the sound is decent but not the best at this price range .. 5. App crashes a lot whenever something heavily runs on an app it closes automatically you have to again open it ... Verdict overall there are pros and cons in every phone but you are getting a value for money mobile around 30k go for it if you like camera and consume lot of content.looks and performance will make you feel love with this but at the moment you type something it gives you the feeling of 10k mobile....\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: It's performance and battery phone. Display though 1.5 k amoled it is not tuned for comfort. Eyes gets hurt. There are better display panels in market with Lil higher range like One plus 12 or Realme GT6 or Xiaomi 13 phones.  Infact Vivo V40 display is tuned differently and is better than T3 ultra.  Some bloatware available but can be uninstalled.  Cooling mgmt is much better than many phones.  This is not a Camera phone but that's okay. Edit your pictures or videos later.  Best part about phone is it's very comfortable for hands. Your fingers (Pinky) or thumb or any other doesn't get strained.  Meditek processor giving smooth experience  Speakers are also good.  No Dolby or HDR display on OTTs like Netflix.  Overall value for money.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The Vivo V30e (Silk Blue, 256GB) is a stylish phone with a large, smooth 120Hz AMOLED display for an excellent viewing experience. It boasts a capable camera system, with a 50MP main sensor that takes great photos, especially in low light. The 256GB storage provides ample space for apps and media, while the 5500mAh battery offers long battery life.  However, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 processor can struggle with demanding games, and the phone lacks features like HDR support. Consider this phone if you prioritize design, camera, and battery life over top-tier performance.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: First thing which makes me unhappy is the delayed delivery from the Flipkart team during preorder, they also asked me to open the box, it was supposed to be gift for my relative in total packed form. I ordered Grey , needless to say that the phone looks so wow. The phone camera performance solely makes it the best photography phone, since you also need a good battery to survive for long hours, you can adjust some of the setting and ensure that camera lasts for additional hours. My purchase is solely for office work and almost zero calling hence the phone battery lasts for more than 60 hours.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice phone. Battery could have been 5000 Mah and processor could have been 8 plus generation. Camera quality is good, captures good images at day light.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome phone  I am writing the review after almost a week of use. Pros: 1. Very good design both in front and back. 2. Lightweight and feels premium in your hand. 3. Beautiful display, treat to your eyes AMOLED, curved screen and 120hz adaptive refresh rate adds to its beauty. 4. Front camera- beautiful, Sony imx 709 really takes beautiful pics in every condition. Back camera: Main camera really works even in low light condition and 32 MP telephoto lens is not a gimmick. It really helps in taking clear pics of distant objects. 5. IR blaster, NFC is there but not making big difference for me.  Cons: 1. Processor: 778G, really in 39k, feels like 20k processor to me. Even a lower priced Reno 10 has a better clocked (2.6GHZ) processor. I was expecting at least dimensity 8200 in this price range. 2. Single speaker. At this price it should have been Dolby Atmos. 3. Battery: 4600 mah is ok ok for me as I am not a gamer and for normal day to day use it lasts one day easily but 5000 could have been better. 4. No IP rating in this price range is a big disappointment.  Even after the drawbacks I gave it a 5* for its design, display and camera. I got the phone at a good bank discount and a handsome exchange offer. I preferred it over Nord 3 for its camera performance and Nord 3's display problem. Overall Its a good buy.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice phone. Battery could have been 5000 Mah and processor could have been 8 plus generation. Camera quality is good, captures good images at day light.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome phone  I am writing the review after almost a week of use. Pros: 1. Very good design both in front and back. 2. Lightweight and feels premium in your hand. 3. Beautiful display, treat to your eyes AMOLED, curved screen and 120hz adaptive refresh rate adds to its beauty. 4. Front camera- beautiful, Sony imx 709 really takes beautiful pics in every condition. Back camera: Main camera really works even in low light condition and 32 MP telephoto lens is not a gimmick. It really helps in taking clear pics of distant objects. 5. IR blaster, NFC is there but not making big difference for me.  Cons: 1. Processor: 778G, really in 39k, feels like 20k processor to me. Even a lower priced Reno 10 has a better clocked (2.6GHZ) processor. I was expecting at least dimensity 8200 in this price range. 2. Single speaker. At this price it should have been Dolby Atmos. 3. Battery: 4600 mah is ok ok for me as I am not a gamer and for normal day to day use it lasts one day easily but 5000 could have been better. 4. No IP rating in this price range is a big disappointment.  Even after the drawbacks I gave it a 5* for its design, display and camera. I got the phone at a good bank discount and a handsome exchange offer. I preferred it over Nord 3 for its camera performance and Nord 3's display problem. Overall Its a good buy.\n",

Design looks good .. touch response is not good as per phone cost. Battery life is good. Its 4g phone and does not support 5g. Charging speed is good. Overall you will get good phone in 15k range.

It could be better in this price Backside is neither metallic nor having glass. It is not giving premium feel from Backside. So I am giving 4 * out of 5 to this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I gifted this brand new phone to my wife and she liked it. The best part is ,its design and features,fast charging, light weight.etc. If we talk about camera it's awesome 108 mp Rear camera and front 32 mp. Plus we don't need to install extra applications for filtering and editing images, We get many options in the Camera settings itself. Go for it. 👍\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Premium looks, Sleek, light weight, curved display adds to the beauty. Amazing sound, one will enjoy the dual speaker soround sound. Battery charging is really fast. backup is OK. But, camera performance is not as expected from Reno series. My Reno 3pro still gives better outcome. 108MP is just a marketing gimmick. Snapdragon processor feels slow as well\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Display is superb. Design also good. Camera average not up to the level Battery good Sound and function rich Touch screen 100 % smooth Go for it\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: OVER PRICED :-  - Display not that curved. Very slightly curved. - CAMERA is hit or miss. Sometimes it takes good photos, most of the time it takes pretty ordinary photos. Colours way off. - Video stabilization on EIS is not that great. - Low light photos are not good. - Sometimes lags.  + Sound is loud and decent. + Good for content watching. + Call quality decent. + All 5G bands  All in all this phone didn't meet my expectations.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Only one question to Oppo  What is the use of 108 MP camera without clarity on pics, can't compete even with regular mid budget phones,  Display and battery having decent score  Overall usage is fine apart from camera quality\n",
